<h1 align="center">The Video Section</h1>
<hr>
<p>With a father working in broadcasting and with a video camera at home fro a 
  very early age I became interested in the art of video taking. Although at first 
  I was more interested in shooting I have moved towards being just as interested 
  in the editing process. 
<p>The aim of this website is to discuss better methods of shooting so that when 
  it comes to watching the footage dissapointments are kept to a minimum. Over 
  the next few days/weeks I hope to add sections on planning a shoot according 
  to the event, thinking of shot lists and how images may be inter cut.
