<h3>The importance of an interesting title for a web page</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today everyone seems to be using the web
either by getting e-mail addresses at places such as Rocketmail, Hotmail, Altavista or
getting webpages from places such as Tripod, The Globe, Xoom and Geocities. The use of the
web has increased at an incredible speed, within the school as well as outside.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is precisely because of this evolution in
technology that the school's electronic magazine should remain with it's name <strong>Kaleidoscope</strong>
rather than changing to <em>Contact</em>. <em>Contact</em> is the old newspaper's title
which to me suggests isolation and reminds me of last year's committee and those before
because they didn't do much in the field of web mastering. I am to change that which is the
reason for which I am spending so much time on it, to establish it outside the school too,
not only within.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kaleidoscope on the other hand suggests tons
of information&nbsp; flowing into one place where people come to read new articles written
by younger students as well as the older ones, after all why should we have the same title
for so many years, especially when this website is blossoming into something great.</p>
<p>Conclusively the motivation of the person working on the website is simultaneously
increased if he is interested in the title, try it out to see how valid it
is.</p>
