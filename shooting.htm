<p align="left"><strong><big>Who participated in the fifth General Assembly of the SLN -
Palais des Nations, Geneva</big></strong></p>

<p>The student League of Nations is a body of students from different schools including
some from the <a href="http://www.ecolint.ch">International school of Geneva</a> as well
as from the United World college of the Atlantic (Great Britain), City technology College
(Great Britain), Inter-Community school (Zurich, Switzerland) and many other schools which
would take to long to list and it's not that important which schools participate. The SLN
event to which I went to was the UN building in Geneva during the fourteenth and fifteenth
of December. </p>

<p><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></p>

<p><strong><big>Some procedures explaining what the participants do and a little bit of
why.</big></strong></p>

<p>Some of the delegations with good speakers have as a goal to present their resolutions
to the General assembly and debate the different articles so that it is either accepted or
rejected. It is interesting also to note the way in which the assembly is controlled
because at the beginning of each resolution there is a demand to see every country that
would like to address that particular resolution either to get more information or to give
more information so that it is sure that all countries do get to say what they have to. </p>

<p>There is another thing which is the right of reply where if one country is attacked or
questioned it has the benefit of answering to the questioning country explaining its views
as well as why. </p>

<p>When all countries which wanted to speak have finished speaking there is a ten minute
pause in the SLN which gives time to the different delegations to ask questions about the
resolution and telling them what they would like to see changed in order to decided on
whether or not to vote yes and whether to abstain.</p>

<p>When the voting takes place every single country present is given a vote and it has the
option to vote yes, no or abstain and it goes in alphabetical order in case you are
wanting to take video of any of this.</p>

<p><strong><big>&nbsp;</big></strong></p>

<p><strong><big>A list of shots you may want for an edit.</big></strong></p>

<p>In order to get a comprehensive edit of the SLN you must make sure to get the actions
described above and so I have decided to compile a list of shots which you may want:</p>

<p>- Shots of the room</p>

<p>- different delegations with the name placard</p>

<p>- shots of the presidential table</p>

<p>- shots of the messengers walking around passing messages from one delegation to the
next</p>

<p>- getting shots of delegations taking notes</p>

<p>- getting one country talking about another and the other country's reaction to make an
interesting sequence</p>

<p>- general shots of the building in which the SLN is taking place</p>

<p>- getting the important personalities on video when they speak to the assembly etc.</p>

<p>I don't know whether this would be of any use to people but I decided to add it to the
page so that next year some other people may be able to assist me in taking video at the
event.</p>
