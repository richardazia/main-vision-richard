<p>"Le Voleur" (The Thief) was shot as a practice of various shots and inter-cutting to create an action sequence. Within this piece I was one of the actors and my role was to steal some jewelry from a box, the owner came into the house, I knock him out and jump out of the window and escape to safety. 
<p>During the filming of this short piece we had to repeat one scene 21 times to get it right because at times the action was too fast, at others there was no feeling and finally it was good. I was in charge of editing the piece with a friend to turn it into the right style of action sequence and it turned out to be a fairly amusing edit.
