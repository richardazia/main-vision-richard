    <td><p align="justify">Script writing is often overlooked by people, thinking that 
  it's a waste of time, that it's boring because it's theoretical. I really enjoy 
  the process though. It requires you to think of a story and how to re-create 
  on paper so that other people understand your vision.I learned of the importance 
  of having a script and storyboard during a shoot we did over a period of four 
  weeks, before the script writing. </p>
<p align="justify">When you're working with a group of students there passion 
  is to get their hands on the camera, to film and to experiment, see what comes 
  out. Without a script you need to be a very strong leader but this is not as 
  interesting. I was caught between wanting to direct and wanting to let them 
  find out for themselves, giving them the creative process. </p>
<p align="justify">I personally longed for a script, longed for a list of shots. 
  With a list of shots you decide on what action is taking place, seeing which 
  angles to cover it and how to make sure to have enough material. </p>
<p align="justify">We've been working on the conventions of script writing rather 
  than script writing itself and it's interesting because from how I understand 
  the process the idea of the script is to provide an outline and a guide as to 
  the story that is being told but without taking other people's creative process. 
  The way I understood the course is that as a script writer your job is to create 
  a maquette from which the director of photography and the director can decide 
  on how best to show the story. We were discouraged from writing camera angles, 
  actors actions and such leaving this open for interpretation. </p>
<p align="justify">I appreciate this lesson because my understanding of script 
  writing for fiction has changed from believing that we should create a shooting 
  script to creating a mould and letting other people paint it and give it life. 
  In other words the process is initiated by an idea which we have. Other people 
  interpret our idea and so the film is born. </p>
<p align="justify">We're a group of uni students learning the whole production 
  process and this is one of the more interesting of the modules. Using cameras 
  and editing are things we can learn when training to do our job whilst script 
  writing is something often overlooked. I love the creative process of video 
  and television production. I love thinking about the content, thinking of the 
  possibilities and narrowing down to what we actually want to create. It's probably 
  for this reason that I enjoy editing so much, the fact that this is where the 
  film comes to life. If you wrote a good script chances are that a person may 
  have the same vision and what had been a few words on a page have now become 
  a program. </p></td>
