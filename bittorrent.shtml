<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Bittorrent</h2>
      <p>Bittorrent is a file sharing method used by a growing number of people. 
        It's main difference lies in it's sharing method. Instead of sharing one 
        giant file such as a movie it shares packets, much as the web is designed 
        to do. This file sharing method takes a file, for example one of the latest 
        movies, splits it into hundreds of packets. As all these packets are made 
        available one person may download a file from several locations. </p>
      <p>Instead of getting one file from one person as you do with Kazaa and 
        other programs you get the same file but fragments of it from hundreds 
        of people. This increases the speed at which you may get files from one 
        location to another. </p>
      <p>It's strength and it's weakness is that it depends too much on other 
        people as with all sharing programs. The advantage though is when downloading 
        popular files. As this network deals with packets from various files rather 
        than complete files sharing may be carried out much faster. Once you have 
        downloaded a small 50 kilobyte segment it is made available for others 
        to download. In so doing the network can expand to such an extent that 
        it works better as more people are downloading. </p>
      <p>Every person downloading the same file can download packets from each 
        other reducing the stress on the one with the most packets. Imagine that 
        you're sharing a book with several hundred pages. As some people have 
        more pages from that book they are able to photocopy and pass on the page 
        to another person and this continues. As more people have copies of the 
        book they should be able to share a higher percentage of the file. This 
        is a highly dynamic method for sharing files and will probably become 
        the future of file sharing. </p>
