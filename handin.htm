<font size="2"></font><font size="3">The projects:</font></p><font size="2">
<p>During a part of the summer holidays I went to Tanzania in order to help
develop the educational ability of the country working in different primary
schools such as Korongoni, Borro, Makaa, Kibo secondary school and the Mkombozi
children's centre.</p>
<p>Borro is a school located among the banana plantations on the outskirts of
Moshi and 45 minutes walking from ISM. When we arrived at the school there was a
classroom which still needed work such as cementing the floor, adding windows,
plastering and then painting the walls making the room much lighter and more
useful for the students.</p>
<p>Makaa primary school had a lack of space to accomodate all of it's younger
students so that they were crowded into a wooden shack and the International
school of Geneva helped to fund the construction of a new building so that the
students may have proper facilities in which to work.</p>
<p>Korongoni involved chiseling holes in the walls where the cables were to be
placed in order to allow electricity to be distributed to the different rooms,
the rooms were cleaned and plastering began and panels were put under the roof
to provide a ceiling so that when rain fell the sound was muffled.</p>
<p>The Mkombozi project involved helping to dig a whole which would then be
cemented and then filled with water so that the children no longer needed to
travel to the river and back to get water for cooking and washing.</font>
