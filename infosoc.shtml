	  <tr><td><p align="justify">During a recent lecture and seminar we explored the 
          idea of information societies, what does it constitute and do we live 
          in one. I enjoy this question and in particular I would like to take 
          a quick glance at what the UNDP and <a href="http://www.ilo.org">ILO</a> 
          are aiming for. Decent work of Children. When younger children are forced 
          to workj then they are not given access to the means of production for 
          an information society. When studying and going to an international 
          school one of the tasks a few of us had been set as a condition for 
          going to Tanzania was fund raising. Over a period of a few weeks we 
          organised methods by which to fund projects in education. These tasks 
          ranged from putting a proper ceiling in some houses, building classrooms 
          in other words or giving them english lessons. </p>
        <p align="justify">In so doing we were transfering knowledge and information 
          from one culture and background to another. The idea of an information 
          society does not have so much to do with whether computers are available 
          etc. but instead whether or not these students have access to primary 
          and secondary education. When education is part of our lives, part of 
          what we have gone through when growing up our understanding and our 
          possibilities to learn more are ever expanding. We are not limited to 
          what we are told or what we are shown, rather we are able to analyse 
          and deal with this information. </p>
        <p align="justify">In the Economicaly more developed countries a great 
          effort is made to bring people to a higher education as shown by various 
          surveys. We are not trained to be labourers, but information workers 
          and in this process machines and people in other countries may become 
          the skilled labourers. In the short run this seems unfair and exploitative 
          but with organisations like the International Labour Organisation aiming 
          to create a fair and equal globalisation for all this is a very important 
          point. This is a fascinating subject therefore I encourage you to visit 
          my <a href="http://www.main-vision.com/forum">forum</a> and discuss 
          this further. </p></td></tr>
