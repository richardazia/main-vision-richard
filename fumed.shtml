    <td colspan="2"> <div align="center"><font size="+1"><strong>On the future 
        of the media: a draft</strong></font></div></td>
<tr><td>
<p align="justify">Over the last fifteen years the media and the digital revolution 
        have changed our lives. The digital revolution has helped people in the 
        economically more developed countries whilst creating a digital divide 
        between poorer countries. As the technology has spread it has enhanced 
        the de-centralisation of industry. Those in Europe and America are part 
        of the management whist those in Asia and around the world work as blue-collar 
        labourers. As a result the there is divide between both groups. Alternately 
        the world&#8217;s culture and communications have become global as in 
        television program schedules and I-tunes with ethnic radio stations. </p>
      <p align="justify">After the <a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/">WSIS</a> 
        conference that took place in Geneva in 2003 there will be another meeting 
        this year in Tunis to discuss information technology and progress for 
        the economically less developed countries. When speaking of the future 
        of the media it is important to remember that education plays an important 
        role in modern society. For Modern technology literacy and an understanding 
        of technology are two necessities without which modern society can&#8217;t 
        work.</p>
      <p align="justify">When Tim Berners Lee created the World Wide Web in 1989-1990 
        at the European Centre for Nuclear research (<a href="http://www.cern.ch">CERN</a>) 
        his aim was for software that was compatible with each operating system. 
        Using a NeXT server he created both the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) 
        and the hypertext markup language (HTML). Over time the technology grew 
        in popularity and within 6 years the technology had 6 million users. The 
        take up had been far faster than with other technologies for the same 
        amount of time. By 2005 it is estimated that there will be over 5 billion 
        text documents on the web. Search engines are an important part in making 
        the World Wide Web usable. On searchenginewatch.com there is discussion 
        on the need for a conference on how to improve search engines and the 
        way they index information. Recently <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">MSN</a> 
        have simultaneously worked on getting desktop search engines to help people 
        index the content of their hard disks due to the increasing amount of 
        images, e-mails, web pages, and videos that can be stored on ever expanding 
        hard disks. We are at a time when the computer will not be left in the 
        study solely for work and playing computer games. It will be brought out 
        and used as a home entertainment unit capable of playing hundreds of hours 
        of music, films and communication. Students are early adopters of this 
        concept since they have limited funds and space.</p>
      <p align="justify">New technologies arrive with no legislation on how to 
        use them. By taking a look at the automobile industry we see how a lack 
        of legislation led to crashes and a lack of security on the roads. In 
        the same way the distribution of music files through software like Napster 
        threatened the music industry. The <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">RIAA</a> 
        had <a href="http://www.napster.com">Napster</a> shut down but within 
        a few years it was back sharing files the legal way. At the same time 
        Ares, Bit torrent and other file sharing software came into existence, 
        improving on old technologies making file-sharing part of everyday life. 
        The <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">RIAA</a> is and still will be suffering 
        from this because we have come to an age of digital reproduction, no longer 
        the mechanical reproduction that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin">Walter 
        Benjamin</a> spoke of. Now a perfect copy of music files can be shared 
        around the world taking and it takes a few seconds to transfer. More to 
        the point there is no need to know the person with whom you are sharing 
        files. New legislation has come into being but chances are that people 
        will continue to share files. It is up to the RIAA to make their product 
        appealing enough to purchase. </p>
      <p align="justify">When television could not be recorded it felt like a 
        novelty for people. In the 1970&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s with the coming 
        of the VHS and Betamax people could time shift programs, picking when 
        to watch them rather than being &#8220;a slave to the box&#8221;. When 
        British Sky Broadcasting came into being it gave a greater variety of 
        programs to its audience. In 1998 the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_revolution">digital 
        revolution</a> would come to satellite broadcasting. A shift from broadcasting 
        to narrow casting occurred, a concept that had been looked down on many 
        years earlier because it did not have mass appeal. </p>
      <p align="justify">When television programming was limited to three or four 
        channels programming was split into time slots based on age and occupation. 
        When the media landscape and the spectrum grew the audience became fragmented. 
        It is based on profession, age, education, interests and ethnic background. 
        If you watch MTV in the UK you will have regional MTV channels for a British 
        audience. In the same way the discovery channels give a choice of civilization, 
        nature and wings. Whatever interests you may become a channel. The advantage 
        of the digital environment is that there is unlimited space and possibilities 
        - as long as you have a hundred thousand pounds to spend you may buy a 
        slot on Sky. Although it is controversial the BBC bought on Sky giving 
        the Sky audience access to public service broadcasting. As time evolves 
        we will find more of these deals. </p>
      <p align="justify">Having so many channels is chaotic and Sky has found 
        the perfect solution. With the electronic program guide they have separated 
        the channels into interests; news and factual, Music, Cinema and special 
        interest. If you are an Arab speaker wishing to watch <a href="http://www.aljazeera.net">Al 
        Jazeera</a> you use the EPG and select the channel. Other companies lack 
        such good EPG and finding your way across more than five hundred channels 
        can be time consuming. As time continues we may find that a search feature 
        is included so that if we&#8217;re looking for a certain film we type 
        the name in and it lists the times at which it&#8217;s shown. For the 
        moment it&#8217;s limited to 48hrs but in the near future it may having 
        planning for up to a week or more. </p>
      <p align="justify"><a href="http://www.bskyb.com">Sky</a> made television 
        more interactive although rather than send SMS by mobile phone or chatting 
        on forums it may be possible to interact with the show by selecting camera 
        angles or by selecting features. E4 have already done this with big brother. 
        Sky news also offers a similar service but with news streams for world 
        news, sports, entertainment and weather. This is a progression from the 
        original teletext where it was a few lines of text. Another advancement 
        is that of High Definition television, a much larger higher quality picture 
        will be seen by the viewer to enhance his experience and surround sound 
        will become mainstream for television programming.</p>
      <p align="justify">Over the last year articles have appeared speaking about 
        something new, pod casting. This is where a radio station is recorded 
        onto an I-pod for time differentiated listening. Radio is no longer based 
        on radio transmitters but rather on streams of data via the web. Channels 
        like <a href="http://www.onefm.ch">One FM</a>, a <a href="http://www.geneva.ch">Geneva</a> 
        based radio station will be available to students as far as California 
        or Sydney. No longer does the audience give up listening to their favourite 
        programs because they are outside the country. The radio station you listen 
        to may be based six thousand kilometres away. More to the point due to 
        its nature radio is cheap. For example, <a href="http://www.srgssrideesuisse.ch/en/radio/rr/en_rr.html">Rumantsch</a>, 
        a Swiss dialect talked by only a hundred thousand people is available 
        on the World Wide Web to a global audience. You may say this is absurd, 
        this demonstrates how technology has allowed for radio to become a global 
        medium. The cost and technology mean anyone can have their own radio station 
        with the right software. This creates copyright issues although companies 
        like <a href="http://www.mercora.com/">Mercora</a> claim to resolve this 
        problem by buying the rights to the music. As to other web radios they 
        avoid scheduling music because it is when music is scheduled that they 
        become illegal.New legislation and agreements will be signed allowing 
        for greater freedom of the use of music.</p>
      <p align="justify">The cinema industry has a lot of money therefore investment 
        goes into innovation. Companies like Pixar are moving away from operating 
        systems like Windows or Apple and moving towards open source software 
        like <a href="http://www.linux.org">Linux</a> because of the flexibility 
        it offers them. They hire their own programmers to develop software for 
        the tasks they require. Timecode explored the use of split screen between 
        four cameras and four points of view. As one story became more important 
        the sound was faded to that camera. In the near future these types of 
        films will be even more interesting. At the moment Microsoft are working 
        on a software which may be bundled with Longhorn which permits for a scene 
        to be seen from several points of view with only one camera. This is a 
        complex operation that requires powerful processors and a lot of ram. 
        Another concept is George Lucas&#8217; use of the video village for scenes 
        with a lot of computer-generated graphics. He films in high definition 
        rather than film. It allows for quicker turn around time because he watches 
        scenes as soon as they are shot and to see what is required. If it is 
        not good then he can re shoot the scene. If it is then he moves to the 
        next scene. One of the great advantages is that it will speed up the process. 
        Filmmaking will no longer take weeks to develop and edit, rather it could 
        be finished within a few days reducing overall costs. </p>
      <p align="justify">Photojournalism is changing from day to day with the 
        progress made with more precise charge couple devices (CCD) and larger 
        hard disks. Currently photographers are hindered because they must take 
        a break from photography to send the previous four hours to their editors 
        to be marketed via the agency&#8217;s website. Two examples are Corbis 
        and Getty images. At the moment this is hinders photographers since they 
        stop what they are doing to send the images. In the near future the camera 
        will be able to send the images back automatically. The photographer will 
        be free to enjoy taking more pictures, getting his assignments by phone 
        and taking more pictures as images are automatically uploaded to the agency&#8217;s 
        server. Trends demonstrate that as technology progresses the interaction 
        between one feature and another become seamless. A big effort is put into 
        making technology as transparent as possible to encourage its use. </p>
      <p align="justify">Recently I read an article saying that with smaller cameras, 
        lighter editing suites and video satellite phones for reporting television 
        crews can move up to forty percent faster than they used to. This is great 
        for covering conflicts in Afghanistan or Iraq because the earth station 
        is no longer a must for 24-hour news channels like BBC news and CNN for 
        example. This is a result of the audience and the broadcasters constantly 
        striving to break the story sooner. Over time the camera on mobile phones 
        will have resolution high enough to be broadcast on television. At this 
        point the job of the cameraman may be easier, especially for live events 
        or getting agency material where an understanding of the story is not 
        as important. In South East Asia after the Tsunami holidaymakers with 
        their cameras took the footage of the actual wave. The journalists and 
        their camera crews came to cover the complex topics like aid, how tsunamis 
        occur and what the governments and world community are doing to help.</p>
      <p align="justify">The future of the Internet is another interesting aspect 
        of the future of the media because of the online convergence. Broadband 
        in the UK has increased with more than half of homes in the UK having 
        access to high-speed Internet access. In France Internet access has already 
        gone up to 15 megabits per second with certain providers. In France during 
        the late 90&#8217;s there was a movement called Internet Moins Cher, (IMC) 
        or cheaper Internet in English. They staged days of protest, for example 
        not connecting to the Internet for a day. As a result progress had been 
        made in France. In 2003 it was declared that there was an overcapacity 
        for the sending of information and this pushed down the prices for users 
        of the technology, promoting new services and features online.<br>
        Websites like Weebl and Bob or atom films can provide content for those 
        with high bandwidth connections enhancing the experience. Images have 
        increased in resolution, content has become more dynamic and communicating 
        online has been simplified. Whereas chatting by MSN messenger, chat rooms 
        and IRC was part of the late 90&#8217;s the next fifteen years will see 
        people using software like <a href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a> rather 
        than landlines and in France there will be no need to have a subscription 
        to a phone service with ADSL. In North America there is the Abilene Internet 
        2 network that is at 100 megabits per second or more, this means that 
        full quality video can be streamed from one part of the US to the other. 
        If you&#8217;re studying music and you have good microphone and sound 
        system you can co-operate from numerous locations without travelling. 
        As a result certain costs are lower and students have access to people 
        they would otherwise have no access to. </p>
      <p align="justify">The Book industry has not seen much change in the past 
        ten years and chances are that it will not change so much within the next 
        ten to fifteen years. Even <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> 
        did not have as much influence as it was expected to. It was found that 
        people prefer to look through a book and feel it in their hands before 
        purchasing it. What Amazon has done is made it easier to buy specific 
        books. Due to it&#8217;s success it has migrated from America to have 
        a website for the UK and another one for France. As to electronic books 
        they have not taken off in the way that was planned, mainly because the 
        technology is expensive, the screens are uncomfortable to read and the 
        batteries would not last long enough. </p>
      <p align="justify">In the United Kingdom where there are a variety of ethnic 
        backgrounds and where the minorities are quite large there is an audience 
        large enough to justify having special interest channels like Al Jazeera, 
        OBE that is an African broadcasting channel or CCTV, a Chinese channel. 
        With these channels on sky we see that England is a mature multicultural 
        environment where diversity is tolerated and a part of everyday life. 
        As time progresses these factors will become more important when measuring 
        audiences.</p>
      <p align="justify">Over the next ten to fifteen years chances are that technology 
        will become smaller and less obtrusive. Mobile telephones will have an 
        ever-increasing number of features, like cinema payment, bus payment and 
        more. The television we watch and the websites we visit will know who 
        we are and provide content that it knows we will enjoy. The Electonic 
        program guide will become more intelligent and have more features, learning 
        our taste and suggesting programs rather than waiting for us to tell it. 
      </p>
      <p align="justify">In economically less developed countries certain phases 
        of media development may be skipped, for example in Africa the mobile 
        infrastructure being set up rather than cable, the use of Linux in computing 
        as the cost is lower and the use of satellite broadcasting for IP and 
        more since the technology is easier to install all over the world. Already 
        countries like India are becoming an important world player in relation 
        to information technologies. </p>
