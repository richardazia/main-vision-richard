<p>Resources are important in today's society therefore it is important to reduce
waste in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>Energy and material use can affect human carrying capacity since the more resources
there are the more people can use them, this however is limited by several factors and it
is therefore important to manage resources better.</p>
</div>

<h2>How To Achieve It</h2>
<a href="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DSC_1322-1536x1152.jpg"><img src="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DSC_1322-150x150.jpg"></a>
<p>recycling, for example in Switzeland there are facilities for each village at the dump
where people sort there trash into different parts these are: paper, aluminium, cooking
oils, PET (plastic), glass (different colours) and garden waste (decaying vegetation)</p>
<p>Re-use: this part may include second hand products such as cars, clothes and more.</p>
<p>re-manufacturing which is similar to recycling may put products such as aluminium cans,
bottles etc. back into the circuit. A way in which this may be done is by melting down the
material and using it for a newer product.</p>

<h2>Cutting Down On Energy Use</h2>
<a href="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_0913-1536x1152.jpg"><img src="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_0913-150x150.jpg"></a>
<p>By increasing the use of public transport we may reduce the amount of emissions into
the atmosphere, this may be done by increasing transport convenience and lowering the
cost. Another method is by using &quot;Green taxes&quot;, these would increase the price
of petrol, increase the cost for using roads and more. </p>
<p>Within the home we may improve the house's efficiency through double glazing which
would reduce heat loss, increase bulb efficiency so that they burn for longer and use less
power and reduce the amount of water used daily within the home.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Materials</h2>
<p>To reduce the amount of materials used we may reduce the amount of packaged products we
buy as the packing is sometimes useless, in other circumstances where it is necessary we
may re-use the container for something else, for example certain jars can be used as
glasses etc. </p>
<p>Another element is whether we need everything we have, for example by reducing on the
amount of objects in our houses which we do not use.</p>
