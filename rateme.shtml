<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Personal rating sites</h2>        
      <p>A strange breed of sites can be found on the web, where people intentionally 
        want them to judge them based on looks. It may seem strange to those of 
        us who believe in getting to know people but apparently they have much 
        success. With Swedish sites like snyggast.com or Estonian sites like rate.ee 
        we are introduced to an interesting world of superficiality... or so we'd 
        think. 
      <p>If you're from an international environment then you're used to hearing 
        people speak about having the most attractive guys or girls. On these 
        sites it is interesting to see which nation has the more attractive people. 
        In such a way the international aspect of the world wide web is brought 
        to viewers. It encourages dialogue between people in different parts of 
        the same country as well as cross border around the world. 
      <p>Some controversy surrounds these sites which may at moments have more 
        explicit images or being dangerous to the less informed people. The danger 
        arises when the younger users decide to meet those they have been chatting 
        to without taking the proper precautions like telling their friends where 
        they are going and whether they could be accompanied for more safety. 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>Why not take at these two sites to get an idea:
      <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050901000000*/http://www.snyggast.se">Snyggast</a> - The website no longer exists so I have linked to the wayback machine.
