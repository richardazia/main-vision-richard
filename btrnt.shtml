<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Bittorrent technology</h2>
        <p>Bittorrent is an interesting technology for those interested in peer 
          2 peer. Whereas the conventional peer to peer system takes files from 
          computer Ato computer B bittorrent takes data from computer A and distributes 
          the data far more effectively. It is based around packet switching as 
          are most programs but the packets take a different form. Bit torrent 
          files are split into small packages which can be downloaded independently 
          from one another. Imagine that you would like to download my <a href="video/l2k3bb.wmv">lakeparade</a> 
          video for example. As you're downloading the file from the server you 
          have to download it from beginning to end. 
        <p>Bit torrent technology takes a file and creates a quantity of small 
          packets or bits. As one packet is made available by one peer you make 
          a request to download that packet. As you leech(download) files from 
          the users you also begin to share(seed) these files with them. This 
          means that you may have ten to twenty people sharing the same video 
          file and each one has certain bits of that file. As the download progresses 
          and the parts are collected you begin to get the whole, in other words 
          a file that you can play on the computer. To explain this technology 
          imagine that your file is a deck of cards. In order to play you need 
          all the cards. The order of the cards (bits) is not important, simply 
          that you get all the cards from that deck (file). Once all the files 
          are collected you can watch the file which you have taken the time to 
          download. 
        <p>This technology is interesting because you are no longer dependent 
          on a single person's connection but rather a collection of connections. 
          You may be downloading from one person at 200 bytes per second and from 
          another person at 6Kbs for example. If you've got a fast connection 
          then you may be using your bandwidth far more efficiently than with 
          programs like Kazaa etc.
