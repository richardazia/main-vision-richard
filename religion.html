<h1>Religion</h1>

<p>The Romans had a religion that had lots of
gods: they were polytheists. They built buildings called temples to worship the
gods. In the temples they had sacrifices to worship the gods. They believed that
to worship a god you had to do it in exactly the right way to be heard by the
gods. They had many gods. They had household gods such as Lar which was god of
the house, They had a god called Janus which was for the doorway. There was also
Vesta the goddess of households. The god Neptune was firstly god of fresh water
but he then became god of the sea. The goddess of fertility was called Cybele.
She was the symbol of earth. They made sacrifices and offered during that time.
They used a flute player to drown the other sounds that could be heard. Every
home had a shrine or altar so that they could pray without going to the temples.</p>
