<p><big><big><big>R</big></big></big>ome, as the capital of the Roman empire, was the most
important city. The city grew and so it became occupied by important buildings. These
buildings are all built close to each other making a center for entertainment and other
causes like political leaders going to the Forum. These buildings are the <a href="colosseu.htm">Coliseum</a> which is the symbol of Rome. There is also the Forum
Romanum which was very important as there were political people who went there to talk.
There were temples to different gods. Commercial people also went there to speak. there
was also the Circus Maximus which was where there were chariot races where the people went
to watch it happening. There was also the <a href="panthe.html">Pantheon</a> which was a
building with a dome over it which had a hole through the top. This was to let in light
but water also came into it. It is the building of all gods and was built by Hadrian in
about 140ad. It is built in stone and is 43 meters in diameter. the dome was built to be
strong so that it would not collapse on people inside. It was also built from cement.
There were statues of the gods. There are also the statues of Caesar, Agrippa and
Augustus. <br>
People live in Insulae at the bottom of seven hills where the city is built. Rich people
had houses on the hills for summer as there were insects and illnesses which spread during
that time of year in the poorer area of the city.</p>
