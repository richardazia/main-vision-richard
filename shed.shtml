<h4 align="center">Shooting for the edit</h4>
<p>If you are just starting out in video then you may believe that video is quite 
  a fast process, all you need to do is take a camera, point it at something and 
  then when you watch it at home it is perfect. Unfortunatley though in most cases 
  there are mistakes in shooting, boring parts and in general far too much footage 
  to watch in one go, especially for the audience. It is for this reason that 
  whenever something is filmed it is important to think about what we are going 
  to do with it afterwards. </p>
<p>Editing is a very interesting and sometimes surreal experience sometimes. It 
  is the process of selecting which images you like best and adding them together 
  to build up a story which your audience will enjoy. 
<h4 align="center">Linear and Non linear editing</h4>
<p>Montage (editing) is carried out most of the time either on a linear or non 
  linear system. Tape editing is refered to as linear because every single edit 
  counts and if a mistake is made the edit must be started from the beginning. 
  It is far more disciplined than non linear editing and because of the inflexibility 
  of the system it forces you to plan how the edit will look at the end. </p>
<p>In comparison non linear editing systems are usually computers. When you have 
  filmed a short fictional piece or home video then you may capture the footage 
  to the computer and import it into any of a range of editing systems. Once the 
  footage is on the computer there is a lot of flexibility of how the edit may 
  turn out. </p>

    </td></tr>
<tr><p><td>
      <div align="center"><b>Timing</b></div>
    </td>
<td><p>When taking still photographs you are used to being able to point the camera, 
  click and have a picture ready. In video it is not as simple because there is 
  the dimension of time to think about. A common mistake which people make when 
  beginning a video taking life is to film too little material. When you arrive 
  at home after the day of shooting and you watch the video it is quite common 
  that you felt as if you filmed for 10 seconds or more but in fact you only have 
  three seconds of footage. The problem with filming is that you are concentrating 
  so much on the framing, the action in front of the camera that time becomes 
  distorted and it takes experience to get used to this. A crucial element of 
  video is having enough material for the edit. If you count seconds in your mind 
  or watch the time code then you will know how long the clip is and frustration 
  will be reduced when you get home in front of your editing system to find you're 
  lacking footage so the edit will be much shorter than you would have liked. 
</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
      <div align="center"><b>Footage ratios</b></div>
    </td>
<td><p>An important thing to remember when shooting for the edit is that although 
  you may have six hours of footage shot over a few days which you would like 
  to condense a fairly normal ratio is around ten to 1. The ratio 10:1 means that 
  although you filmed 10 minutes you may only keep one minute. This is particularly 
  important to remember when shooting a birthday party and other events where 
  you are not sure what the most important and entertaining moments will occur. 
  Overshooting some parts may seem stupid but when you have to much material then 
  you have a choice of what you would like to do with it. The more footage you 
  have to chose from the more entertaining and entertaining the video will become. 
  An example of this is the lake parade which takes place in Geneva each year. 
  Although I filmed around an hr and a half I kept 1 minute. At the beginning 
  your shooting ratio may be around 20:1 or more but as you gain more experience 
  and know which shots work and which are entertaining you may give yourself the 
  luxury of shooting less footage yet getting a very entertaining piece out of 
  your material.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
      <p align="center"><b>Variety of shots</b></p>
    </td>
<td><p>Filming is a dynamic medium which requires for you to think in terms of shots 
  or images. Each image that you get can help contribute to the story you would 
  like to tell. If you would like to make a video of an event then it is important 
  to think about what the event is. If you are filming a birthday then you must 
  think of a list of shots which you will need to show others what the birthday 
  was like. At the beginning of your filming life it may be an idea to spend a 
  short amount of time planning the variety of shots which you would like to get. 
  The shots for a birthday may be friends of the person, the gifts received, the 
  pre party preparations with shots of balloons being inflated, the excitement 
  of the child whose birthday it is etc. At the same time the birthday party may 
  be divided between games, present opening and food. If we take these basic elements 
  of the event then we already have at least five minutes worth of footage to 
  illustrate the story whilst keeping it as dynamic as possible.</p></td></tr>
<tr><td>
      <p align="center"><b>Zooming and panning</b></p>
    </td>
<td><p>Zoomitus refers to the bad habit which people have of always zooming in and 
  out when holding the camera. It's fine if you're aiming to show how big a room 
  is but at the same time it may be far more useful to think of another way of 
  showing the room. When the zoom has been used to much then the editor will find 
  it extremely hard to edit the material with control of length. If you use the 
  zoom then make sure to get 5 seconds or more at the beginning of the zoom which 
  is static and the same at the end. This will allow you the flexibility of choosing 
  whether to use the zoom or cuts instead. </p>
<p>Another common problem is simply moving the camera all the time because it's 
  hard to decide on what the center of interest is. If the camera is not still 
  then it is hard to find a point at which to start using the footage and at what 
  point to exit the shot. In keeping the camera you will find editing far more 
  relaxing because you know that you start when you like and end when you like. 
  In editing time is of the essence. You are finally given the ability to cut 
  out the boring bits and emphasise the most interesting moments of the event 
  so that instead of putting your audience to sleep they will be entertained and 
  want to see more. </p></td></tr>
