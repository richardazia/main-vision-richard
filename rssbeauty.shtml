<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
<h2>An RSS aggregated world</h2>
        <p>Really Simple Syndigation is one of the best ideas in 
          the world and I love it. Called RSS for short and refered to as an aggregation 
          this is one of the greatest advances to come out within the past few 
          months. I love RSS because it's so easy to use and it's such a time 
          saving tool. What's even better is just how modulable and adaptable 
          it is. </p>
        <p>I am interested in several topics, world news (studying 
          a News course), international relations (from working for the ILO, the 
          WHO, ICRC and more), public relations (course I'm studying), technology 
          and it stretches as far as your mind. The reason it's so great is that 
          there are so many websites out there that I may have to visit twenty 
          websites for a bit of news and that's time consuming. In other circumstances 
          I checked e-mailed newsletters but I do not like these because you get 
          all the articles in one go and you saturate with information, reading 
          less than a quarter of what is made availble. </p>
        <p>At the moment there are two RSS feeds for this website. 
          The first one is for the &quot;What's new&quot; section of the website, 
          keeping people up to date with what new things I have added to the site 
          and the second is for an online game named Kraland. I hope that through 
          both of these threads I keep people up to date with what I find is either 
          interesting or important to keep up to date with. </p>
        <p>I am starting to hate installing things onto the laptop 
          as this slows down the machine. Instead I have decided to use both my.yahoo 
          with their beta feed reader and bloglines which was recently aquired 
          by Ask Jeeves because the manager was so interested in bloglines. Both 
          of these have a slightly different user interface. For a start Bloglines 
          allows you to collate all the feeds into a list in on the left hand 
          site with the content on the right hand side. With this each time you 
          click on a feed the right hand contains all the new articles and if 
          you chose you may have headlines, summaries, or full articles. I have 
          recently moved on to chosing full articles so that I may read these 
          in the comfort of just one browser window rather than opening a new 
          one every article. Yahoo prefers to give you feeds as titles, and according 
          to the title you select which ones you want to read by clicking on them, 
          as hyperlinks. Both interfaces are good although I prefer the bloglines 
          approach. </p>
        <p>As rss readers become more popular and as more websites 
          realise how important and how interesting rss feeding becomes to their 
          viewers they will make it more and more prominant. Personally I have 
          been surfing and found that there are certain websites which I know 
          I will follow less closely because they have not yet deemed it necessary 
          for an RSS feed. They are a great tool for PR departments and international 
          organisations. Already the ILO, Google and MSN for example use bloggers 
          who create RSS feeds to form a new brand loyalty so to speak. Take the 
          time to learn how RSS works and you may enjoy it as much as I do.</p>
