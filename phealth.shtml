<p>Pompeian's were well nourished and healthy. Only about 10% showed signs of 
  arthritis (mainly in the old). 11% of the female skeletons revealed symptoms 
  of a minor disorder called Hyperostosis Frontalis Interna (HFI). Other signs 
  showed that Pompeian's lived well into their 50's and 60's. The 
  teeth in many of the skulls were very worn down, some showing the nerve. This 
  was probably caused by grit or stones found in bread. Some teeth had cavities 
  and heavy build of plaque. Signs of gum disease and abscesses related to tooth 
  decay. No signs of dental extractions, fillings, crowns or false teeth. Archaeologists 
  found the main causes of death:</p>
  <p>Asphyxiation ( suffocation) was most common <br>
  Thermal shock <br>
  Concussion from projectiles or falling masonry/timbers. <br>
