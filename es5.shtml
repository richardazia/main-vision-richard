<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Earth Station Five</h2>
        <p>For all those of you music lovers out there with broadband access to 
          the World Wide Web and the Internet I found a software which may be 
          of interest to you. <a href="http://www.es5.com">Earth Station 5</a> 
          is a peer to peer file sharing program which allows you to share files 
          with people around the world without all the Spyware software. </p>
        <p>Over the past few days I have been running a few test downloads of 
          movies and MP3 files to establish whether file sharing is ready and 
          of interest to the public. If you've got ADSL then you know that downloading 
          files is very fast compared to the slow dial up modems of two years 
          ago. In the meantime what you'll have to contend with is the slow uploading 
          speed that is offered by this technology. It's a permanent connection 
          so you don't really care about the downloading time although the main 
          problem is spending entire days downloading a film and finding that 
          the file is corrupted or that the user from which you're downloading 
          the file decides to turn off his machine leaving you without a complete 
          file download. </p>
        <p>On the other hand when talking about MP3 downloading this is quite 
          a powerful tool, limited mainly by what people decide to share on the 
          World Wide Web. If you're interested in all the most up to date music 
          then there's a high probability that you'll find these files quite easily. 
          If you're interested in some of the more classic music such as Pixies 
          then you may find that the files are not there. </p>
        <p>What's interesting about the possibility of downloading MP3 is the 
          ability of finding songs which you think you like, listening to them 
          and evaluating whether they are worth buying or whether you'd prefer 
          to spend your music in other places. </p>
        <p>Apart from sharing of music there is also the possibility of downloading 
          other file formats, whether film, documents, images etc. If you've created 
          films which you think would be of interest then you will be able to 
          serve those files from your computer to those of interest. I'm interested 
          in distributing the various videos I create and making them available 
          to my friends and one of the ways in which I could do this is through 
          peer to peer file sharing. It may require a bit of time depending on 
          how compressed the files are. Essentialy imagine you're at a protest 
          and you film some of the actions, get some key sound bytes and want 
          to share them with friends. By &quot;sharing&quot; those files you're 
          communicating your message to a larger audience. All you need to do 
          is encourage the people to download <a href="http://www.es5.com">Earth 
          Station five</a> and give them the name they should search for. For 
          example&quot;Geneva anti g8 Protests 2003&quot; may be a file name you 
          use to allow people to see your own interpretation of events. </p>
