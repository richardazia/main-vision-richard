<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Finding Wifi hotspots</h2>
        <p>As internet access becomes a more pervasive part of our 
          lives it is important for us to remain in contact with the outside world. 
          As a student you may find that Internet access is hard to find as providers 
          offer deals which must last for at least six months or more. This means 
          that if you're living in a place for a short amount of time access to 
          high bandwidth internet access is more complicated to find. </p>
        <p>With websites such as <a href="http://totalhotspots.com">TotalHotspots.com</a> 
          the task of finding a place from which to gain internet access has been 
          easier for those with WiFi capabilities on their laptop. If they want 
          to find a cheap place from which they want to access the web, for example 
          a petrol station, a coffee bar etc. they can check the website before 
          going to that location. In other circumstances thanks to text messages 
          people will be told where to find the closest hotspot. </p>
        <p>In so doing the conventional agreement with phone companies 
          is no longer the same. Instead of taking a contract you find a place, 
          log on and surf the web. You may find some places which are cheap, others 
          slightly more expensive but measured on an hourly or monthly basis depending 
          on what interests you. </p>
        <p>This opens up a really interesting ability for bloggers, 
          webmasters, businessmen and more to do what they want from a location 
          which they find more convenient or comfortable. </p>
        <p>What if a portable telephone was designed with wifi access 
          in mind or even a watch. As you walk in a city the watch detects whether 
          wifi is available and the owner then connects from any location. It's 
          the future of mass communication. </p>
