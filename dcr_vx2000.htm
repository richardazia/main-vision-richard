<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The VX 2000 is a good all round camera, it is
easy to use and has many features which would encourage someone to use it. From
the outside we see that the camera has a focusing ring and a zoom ring, both accessible
at the same time unlike with other camera models. The focus ring is fairly easy
to use although it takes a little bit of time to become fully proficient. The
zoom can be controlled by servo or manually at different speeds, when the zoom
is controlled manually though the motor is taking feedback from your fingers for
speed rather than being applied directly to the lens.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the lens we find incorporated two
neutral density filters giving us a choice between three options, first one is
without filter letting all light fo through the lens to the three chips, second
setting is a neutral density filter to take away some contrast. We then arrive
at ND2 which is a stronger neutral density filter which is normally used during
full daylight. In order to control exposure there is a button on the left which
needs to be pressed in order to go into manual iris, there is a wheel below
where the aperture can be controlled.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are three chips to capture the light
information rather than a single chip thus improving the look of the image. If
we find that we are in a dark room then we can boost the gain if we want but if
someone does not want to use the gain then it is possible to take the shutter
from 1/10 000 of a second to 1/3rd of a second . The shutter speed is controlled
from the back of the camera via pressing the shutter speed button on the back
and turning the wheel below for the correct speed. This greatly increases the
light coming into the lens. As an illustration I have shot scenes with light far
too low for cameras such as the Canon XL-1 to cope with and the most spectacular
part is how little noise shows up on screen afterwards.</p>
<p ALIGN="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For sound we have an onboard microphone which
is good for ambiance sound and it is possible to plug in a mic with a 3.5mm
plug. We have two settings for the microphone, either as microphone (plug in
power) or as line in. Once the microphone is selected we can check the sound
levels through preswsing the audio level at the back which will display the
sound. Through the menu it is possible to choose between automatic or manual. By
selecting manual the level may be adjusted with the db meter in camera showing
-30 -20 -12 -8 -4 0 etc. so that the sound engineer may get the correct level
for recording.</p>
<p align="left">Additional comments</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The centre of gravity is well placed on the
tripod so that it lies at the same place as the mounting plate making it easier
to use on a tripod. The tape compartment is accesible at all times closing in
two stages, firstly getting the mechanical part in place, tape winded and ready
to shoot followed by shutting the door to avoid dust coming in. With there being
two record buttons, one close tothe front right of the camera and the other in
the normal position there is a greater variety of shots possible.</p>
<p align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An interesting feature with this camera is
the possibility of creating an edit decision list within the camera so that it
can behave as an edit controler to dub scenes onto a second device. It is dv
enabled thereby allowing to copy material from one dv tape to an other. Included
with this is the possibility to play from any device directly into the camera
for copying tapes etc. onto a dv tape.</p>
