<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <p>whilst surfing the world wide web sometimes it's interesting to do 
          some site hoping, going from one domain name to another and seeing what's 
          special about the site. In so doing recently I arrived onto <a href="http://www.nochicktrix.com">Nochicktrix.com</a>, 
          an interesting forum with some daily rants which are quite amusing. 
          Some include ferrets in trains, people tricked into spending thousands 
          of dollars on the supernatural etc. </p>
        <p>The Ambiance within these forums can be quite interesting with the 
          variety of people within. It is quite different from <a href="http://www.the-flispide.co.uk/forum/">The 
          Flipside</a> in that it's an American site therefore it's more active 
          during an American day rather than say a European day and the ambiance 
          is quite different. Get to know the various people within this community 
          and appreciate exploring various forums and their way of treating the 
          medium.</p>
