<p>I have been a scuba diver for a little over a year now, having received my <a href="http://www.cmas.org">CMAS</a>
1st star after having done a few back to back dives in Martinique. For more than
a year after this I had no opportunity to go diving until I arrived into
Weymouth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some of the university papers I was informed that there was <a href="http://www.divedorset.com">scuba
center</a> and I went there to find out more about the site for diving etc. and
it's only around three months later that I went diving. I am in the process of
converting from CMAS towards the <a href="http://www.padi.com">PADI</a> open
water advanced at the moment and at the same time I have received a dry suit specialty
diver certification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to a storm having blown over this area this week end it made diving
fairly interesting damaging visibility, creating quite a bit of water movement
and with it finding that there is a lot of sediment in the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first dive was down to the dredger which is a broken up wreck. It is
divided into two parts and is found directly outside Portland Harbor. It is at
varying from 6 to 12 meters and broken up with two main sites along the wall.
When I went down visibility was down to half a meter due to all the silt around.</p>
<p>The second and third dives I have done in England were to a small landing
craft from the second world war. It's in one piece and rests at a depth of 15
meters. It is around 30 meters long and the shot line goes down to the left side
of the craft where the ramp to go down is located. Navigating the wreck is fairy
easy mainly because it is a rectangular box of which you arrive near the&nbsp;
front left side. Navigate along the left side of the craft towards the back of
the craft and looking within the craft you will notice the chains which were
probably used to lower the ramp and foot holes to climb out and into the craft.
AS you arrive to the back you will find that there is a cabin above the rest of
the craft. It is fairly damaged and is fairly flimsy to the touch so while
diving here be careful not to cause to much strain on the structure. Around the
back of the cabin a fuse box of some kind can be found. It is located underneath
the cabin, near the back. It can be seen through descending a little into the
wreck so that you are above a cylinder with ropes on it and looking across to
the left under the support for the cabin (not very well explained I know). Among
the dangers in this wreck are the chains which may give way letting the ramp
open, the flimsy cabin walls and a certain risk of entanglement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall diving in the UK in winter is interesting, visibility can be low, had
half a meter&nbsp; visibility on the first day and two meters on the second
which compared to the Caribbean is fairly poor. When I was in Martinique the
visibility was so good that at 18 meters you still had perfect visibility, being
as far as your eye can see before the blue becomes too dense to distinguish
objects. Air consumption in English waters is fairly fast due to the cold and
using a dry suit which I am not used to, having certified on the 25th and being
the 26th of November when I wrote this.</p>
