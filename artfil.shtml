<h1>Does Art have something to fear from the industrialisation of the processes?</h1>
</div>
<div>
<p>Art is a concept which is based on several factors such as your age, where 
  you are from and how much you know about the topic. It is seen by some as something 
  which must be clear and reflect reality. At the same time though some schools 
  of thought believe that art can be something far more abstract where it is hard 
  to recognise what you see as being anything at all. </p>
<p>Art in it's most basic form and more popular definition is a work which may 
  be sculpture, photography, a good piece of music and more. If we think of art 
  in this way then we are going along a realist stream of thought such as artists 
  like Michelangelo, Emile Zola and Leonardo Da Vinci. These are examples of artists 
  who are very skilled at recreating reality in their medium. To some degree therefore 
  is a question of skill which exceeds other artists of the time. </p>
<p>With the advent of photography though surrealism began to appear because creating 
  something real was carried out by photography in a fraction of the time. It 
  now became important for experimentation with ideas in order to form art. Painters 
  like Dali, Picasso and Andy Warhol are but a few of the artists who have played 
  around with abstract art. </p>
<p>Picasso is interesting in this particular essay because of his Guernica picture, 
  showing the bombing in Spain and the suffering. At a time when photography and 
  film could have been used he used forms on a canvas in an attempt to convey 
  the suffering of the people. Andy Warhol is a more interesting artist because 
  whereas today we may think that it's junk it was greatly admired in the past. 
  We see the soup cans for example and are led towards a perception that they're 
  all the same except for the label describing their contents. To today's person 
  this is boring because we are so used to seeing this. It has become mundane 
  due to the industrialisation in part of art. The car crash series are another 
  interesting piece of experimental art because we are all aware of films having 
  frames and read comics which also use cartoons to illustrate. When seeing this 
  art I had the impression that anyone with a film camera or an editing system 
  could extract 6 frames at different moments, put them together and call it art. 
  With Andy Warhol I would say that because of the time at which he produced his 
  commercial art it was considered quite interesting. Today though it's interest 
  has been ruined by how easily we can do the same thing. </p>
<p>Andy Warhol broke from the norm by showing the Empire State building as a single 
  long shot with no editing as if it was a window looking out onto the building. 
  With his aim of trying to get people to view this art his idea was to get people 
  to talk. In contrast we see that Soviet film makers such as Sergei Eisenstein 
  was aiming at a form of art or communication called intellectual montage whereby 
  through the craft of combining images and symbols which may be unrelated a message 
  can be communicated to the audience. This was a great and interesting art form 
  which to some degree was re-used by many directors of which one was A Clockwork 
  Orange by Stanley Kubrik. The film which is about ultra violence breaks away 
  from the television norms by it's content and resembles opera as if you were 
  watching a modern version of Sergei Eisenstein's Ivan Grozny for example. It 
  is a very interesting film because after the first screening we may not have 
  understood the real implications of the film and through watching it again we 
  get a better understanding of the film's real purpose. This masterpiece has 
  shown what an advantage technology and industrialisation have brought to film 
  making as a process. </p>
<p>A problem occurs when we begin to look at directors such as Spielberg among 
  many others. Cinema has become far too commercial and films can be made at such 
  a rate that at one time in Rome one film was turned out a day which is similar 
  to television series today. When the aim is entertainment it is understandable 
  that this process may be used, particularly since it brings in so much money. 
  The problem though is that because of the speed at which films are made they 
  lack any depth and integrity. They are always about the central topics of love, 
  war and comedy as a majority. During a period I went to see 90 films at the 
  cinema within around 9 months and I got sick and tired of always seeing the 
  same thing over and over with hardly any change in story and plot. The industry 
  had ruined my perception of the cinema as an art form and my interest in American 
  films especially plummeted and turned my eyes towards the less industrial films 
  where there was some meaning and purpose to the films. </p>
<p>With the digital revolution film making has re-democratised itself so that 
  for a far lower budget we may get the same image quality as if we were using 
  film and this is helping a new revival in the documentary genre for example 
  with films like War Photographer about James Nacthway or Atenjurat, legend of 
  the fast runner speaking of Inuit life on the ice. Finally more people may start 
  expressing themselves through the art of the moving image. </p>
<p>Upon analysis of films in particular as an art form we find that because the 
  process is so rigid and films may be over produced in terms of characters being 
  the same and following the same plots the cinema is going down hill towards 
  nothing more than a friday night entertainment form which may be forgotten within 
  the next hour. There are however films which have greatly profited through the 
  industrialisation of cinema, for example films like Kubrik's A Clockwork Orange 
  or Sergei Eisenstein's Alexandre Nevsky.</p>
