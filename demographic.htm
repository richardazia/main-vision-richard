<h1>The Demographic transition Model</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition" target="blank">demographic transition model</a> as you may guess is a model, in other words it is a certain
amount of data taken raw and transformed into something which people may understand. In
other words it is an oversimplification of reality. The demographic transition model has
taken data from industrialised countries such as England, France and many more in order to
see what similarities there are between countries and deciding what stage other countries
are going through at this moment in time. It is divided into 4 stages, The first being the
most primitive and fourth as being the most developed even though there may be a fifth
stage</p>

<h3>Stage 1</h3>
<p>Stage one of the demographic transition model is the most primitive of the stages where
there is a high fluctuating birth and death rate. Because of this there is no great
population growth. These countries or even tribes have very basic living standards such as
those in the Amazon rainforest where they hardly have any education, medicaments or birth
rates such that population is based on food supply, health of tribe members etc. Other
factors involved are no family planning therefore many children or because of the faith of
the people which may look at large families as a sign of verility etc.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Stage 2</h3>

<p>In this stage of the demographic transition model there are a lot of births, however
the death rate has gone down to about 20/1000 infants who die. This results in a rise in
population due to the fact that more infants are surviving. Reasons for which more people
may be surviving may be better health care, improved sanitation such as water etc, more
transport and medical care as well as inventions relating to this. In other words this
stage involves a slight modernisation in health care raising people's living standards as
well as their life expectancy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Stage 3</h3>

<p>Stage three is the stage at which there is already a low death rate as well as a
declining birth rate therefore leading to a slight increase in population. The reason for
the fall in births may be due to family planning, better education, lower infant mortality
rate, a more industrialised way of life and the want for more material possesions as well
as women being able to go out to work. In other words these countries are in the final
stages of becoming like the western countries such as the states and those in Europe.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Stage 4</h3>

<p>Stage four is the one at which Switzerland is. There is a stable population whithout
much change because both the death and birth rate are low and in some cases there are more
deaths than births therefore leading to a possible stage five. </p>
</div>
<div class="links">
<h3>A possible stage five?</h3>

<p>A country such as Sweden is currently entering into the negative growth rate meaning
that there are less births than deaths so that the country's population size is decreasing
leading to problems which will be discussed later on this page. To quote &quot;Geography:
An Integrated Approach by David Waugh &quot;Will there be a <strong>stage 5</strong> where
birth rates fall below death rates to give a declining population?&quot;</p>

stage?</strong></a></p>
