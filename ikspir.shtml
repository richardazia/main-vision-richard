<h1><b>Spiritus</b></h1>
<p>Spiritus written by Ismail Kadare at first begins as a story which I thought 
  would be quite boring, about spirits, spiritism and more. As I read through 
  the book and the characters developed I became more and more interested by the 
  story. It's a cyclical novel beginning with a team of researchers looking to 
  find out who was Shpend Giraziu and how people were contacting him. </p>
<p>By progressing through the book I soon found that in fact it's a novel about 
  the methods by which spying was done in Albania with &quot;Frelon&quot; and 
  &quot;Prince&quot;. These two objects are recording devices which were used 
  as ears for the soviet reginme of the time. It goes into some detail about the 
  methods by which the classical spies who use their ears took time to perfect 
  methods of listening in to other people's conversations. Some went death from 
  working around planes and such whilst others simply listened during theatre 
  peices and more. </p>
<p>The Frelon which is one of the most interesting of the listening devices was 
  sown into people's clothing to provide ears for the intelligence services. These 
  ears would make people more careful of speaking around clothing and more. Some 
  time is taken to explore where they can plant the listening devices and why 
  it would be interesting to use listening devices in places such as theatre shows 
  and more. </p>
<p>The idea that the service could listen may not sound like much to us today 
  as we are used to all these various technologies which surround us. At the time 
  though one of the main protagonists has a hard time. This hard time becomes 
  especially apparent when because Shpend Guraziu was killed by a bulldozer and 
  he was buried without the device being removed the body had to be exhumed. In 
  exhuming the body a question of ethics is explored, seeing whether this is right 
  or not and how various people may see this. This particular occurence is what 
  leads to the notion of Spiritus, or <i>shpirt</i> which means Mon Ame, or &quot;Soul&quot;. 
</p>
<p>Through a nightmare which the main protagonist has we are exposed to the idea 
  that he is in fact uncovering the dead and getting them to speak, as if he was 
  the devil, having a guilty conscience. </p>
<p>It's an interesting read for those who have not yet heard of it and I'd recommend 
  it as a worthwile read. I am going to coninue reading these interesting books 
  and I hope that I have presented a new and interesting author to you the reader 
  of this page.</p>
