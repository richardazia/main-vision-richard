<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Being a student in 2004 on Campus</h2>
        <p align="justify">When I was a student a few years ago in England I was 
          in a house in a town away from London. Life as a student has changed 
          since then. At the moment for example I have a download speed of around 
          1.5 to 2 megabytes per second, 20 hr access to the library and electronic 
          booking out. All these combine to make life at university less challenging, 
          especially when you think of how broadcasters are changing the way we 
          access to their services. </p>
        <p align="justify">At the moment I'm listening to BBC world's Click online 
          program but recently I've been listening to NRJ and one FM, to radio 
          stations I listen to whilst in Switzerland. I have access to TSR news, 
          France 2 news and other channels. I have access to all the online newspapers 
          and I can see whatever country's news I want. It is no longer country 
          specific so I have a huge amount of information accessible from the 
          laptop in front of me now. </p>
        <p align="justify">My phone is no longer limited to chatting to people 
          but rather at using programs so that I can chat to the same people as 
          I would on MSN messenger for example.</p>
        <p align="justify">One of the best tools though is Skype allowing me to 
          chat with friends and family without having to use conventional phone 
          technology. </p>
