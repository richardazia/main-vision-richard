<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves, a weekly article</h1>
<h2>Picasa 2 and Hello from Google</h2>
        <p>I have two mobile phones at the moment, one 
          of them I bought after another was stolen whilst in Paris. The second 
          I received when I became a student. With the first of these phones I 
          was able to take pictures but when it came to getting them onto the 
          computer I had to pay. The second phone, one I use in England is far 
          better. i can take many more pictures and the transfer to hard disk 
          is very simple, especially with the I book since it has bluetooth incorporated 
          within.</p>
        <p>As a result of cameras being added to devices 
          such as phones a new movement has formed. As more and more people take 
          digital images the ability to tell our lives through pictures has become 
          more inmportant, especially as airlines like easyjet make flying cheaper. 
          </p>
        <p>On the hard disks there are more and more images 
          piling up making it hard to remember all the file names and see where 
          the images are. Recently <a href="http://www.picasa.com/index.php">Picasa</a>, 
          a software developed by Google helped to reference all these files and 
          make it far easier to find. Even more recently <a href="http://www.picasa.com/index.php">Picasa 
          2</a> came out. The second version is even better than the first because 
          it enables you to keep track of all images and modify them if you feel 
          they could be better.</p>
        <p>As add on feature, keeping in mind that google 
          is a web based company, they have given the posibility of uploading 
          the images to blogs through an add on called <a href="http://www.hello.com/">Hello</a>. 
          Combined these softwares make it far easier to keep an image diary for 
          friends to see. </p>
        <p>I tested this software and within half an hour's 
          work <a href="http://richard-ch-uk.blogspot.com/">here</a> is the <a href="http://richard-ch-uk.blogspot.com/">result</a>.</p> 
        <p>First of all I started picasa 2 and told it to reference all image 
          files on my hard disk. Once this was completed I chose a few images 
          which I thought would look good in a blog and highlighted them. Once 
          this was done I went to the hello button and clicked it. It opened the 
          hello software and I created an account on <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger.com</a>. 
          Once these steps were completed I logged in and I could start uploading 
          images one at a time with a comment to go with each. This software is 
          incredibly easy to use and I would recommend it for all those who enjoy 
          taking and sharing pictures. </p>
        <p>As more people use this feature the sharing of images will be easier 
          and it will help people understand the daily lives of those in other 
          countries. </p>
