<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves - A weekly Article</h1>
<h2>ICQ (I seek you)</h2>
<p>Over a year ago my brother's friends downloaded ICQ and he was introduced to
it and I was introduced to it, I am talking about version 3.1. Today we have
seen the ICQ98Beta and then the ICQ99a version, the one I am currently using.
Among the things I remember about this is that it was designed by some Israeli
students so that people could communicate all over the world using it, several
months after I started using it was the ICQ cost scare, that is to say that
since AOL was buying the technology there were many messages circulating and
some are still circulating today, although the first messages were unfounded.</p>
<h2>The capabilities and stats:</h2>
<p>Now that I've given you a little history on its history I feel I should
inform you of what its capabilities are. Most people I know have at least one
e-mail account and know how to send and receive electronic mail. ICQ is similar
to this except that it is a free software and once it is downloaded (it is
large, more than a megabyte and when using a 26k modem it can take time) it is
very useful, It has up to 30 million users and I am the 9802494th person to
register a user name, not bad eh?</p>
<h2>Instant messaging:</h2>
<p>Moving on from all this information we now move onto its capabilities, it is
a software which enables instant messaging to people all over the world in the
same way as e-mail except that you see not only when the person is online but
they also see when you're online. This means that while I am doing some research
on the Absurd, Camus etc. I can chat to someone at the same time, a new way of
surfing the World Wide Waves of data coming from all over the world as well as
your friends.</p>
<h2>your friends?</h2>
<p>Yes, that's right your friends, How many of you have to call several friends
in a day? I don't but that's not the point, I enjoy going online at certain
times because I know that I will find certain of my friends. If I elaborate on
this point I know that quite a few people use the messaging mode to send
messages but another one is an IRC chat.</p>
<h2>What's an IRC chat?</h2>
<p>An IRC chat is an internet relay chat, this means that if I was chatting to
you, the reader then you would see the words progress on the screen as you see
in film (let's you see whether someone has the same typing speed as you for
example) Now when there are several people in this chat then you've got data
streaming in from several other points so that four or more people may be in the
same conversation. To give an example to those who have not tried it it is like
being in a classroom or in town seated around a table and conversing.</p>
<p>In brief ICQ is a software you can download from the WorldWideWeb at <a href="http://www.icq99.com">www.icq99.com</a>
which enables you to see which of your friends are online and allowing you to
converse with them while you are surfing the web. It is also good for shy people
as I once was because you learn how to be talkative without having much to lose,
you have more to gain, learning the art of conversation and once you've started
enjoying it online you'll test it elsewhere. e.g. in School etc for example.</p>
<p>Ciao</p>
<p>happy surfing</p>
