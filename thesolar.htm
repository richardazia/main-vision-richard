<p align="center"><big>In Salzburg on the 11th of August was a total eclipse which I was
there to witness</big></p>

<p>The solar eclipse took several hours in going through all the stages, firstly when the
moon begins to cover the moon little by little, then as it becomes more covered the light
properties change, it starts getting darker and shadows are different to what we
normally see, some people have said there are no shadows. As it gets to 90% or more it begins to
get dark and if you go to a high position then you may see the shadow coming towards you,
however if you are in a group of people it may be interesting to see how people react,
this is where I was, in a crowd, as the light begins to shimmer people begin to be excited
and a slivery light is now visible, a few more seconds and shimmering begins. Very soon
after that the sun is covered and we see the corona in all it's majesty and we hear the
people going wild with excitement and the photographers take pictures of the moon etc.
hoping to get at least one good picture.</p>
