<div>
    <h2>Features trade winds produce</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>West coast deserts</h3>
<p>These mainly occur in the trade wind belt on the western side of continents where the
winds are offshore. On shore local winds do blow across these coasts but they rarely, if
ever, bring rain because they have to cross cool currents which parallel the coasts in
these latitudes. The cool currents cause condensation to take place in the on shore wind
which produces mist, fog or light rains. By the time they reach the coasts the winds are
dry. E.g.: Sahara desert Africa </p>
<h3>Continental deserts</h3>
<p>These occur in the interior of continents where the winds have already traveled a considerable distance across the land and in doing so, have lost much of their moisture as
happens when winds blow over a dry land or even high mountains. The day temperature of
these continental areas are very high because they are so far from the moderating
influence of the sea. The night temperatures are low because the absence of clouds causes
these areas to lose their heat rapidly. Deserts of this type occur mainly in west tropical
latitudes but they do extend into the temperate zones. Sometimes these deserts occur in
intermontane zones plateau regions. The deserts of Arizona and Nevada in the Rockies are
of this type and they are sometimes known as mountain deserts. A desert often occurs
because of a combination these factors e.g. the sahara and the Australian desert are
partly of the west coast type and partly of the continent type.</p>

<div>
<h2>Desert types</h2>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Sandy Desert </h3>
<p>Called erg in the Sahara and Koum in Turkestan. This is an undulating plain of sand
produced by wind deposition.</p>
<h3>Stony desert</h3>
<p>Called reg in Algeria and serir in Libya and Egypt. The surface of this desert was
covered with boulders and angular pebbles and gravels which have been produced by diurnal
temperature changes.</p>
<h3>Rocky desert</h3>
<p>Called hammada in the Sahara. The bare rock surface is formed by deflation which
removes all the small loose rock particles. A part of the Sahara desert in Libya
has
extensive areas of this type of desert.</p>
<h3>Badlands</h3>
<p>This is quite a different type of desert to the three just mentioned above in that it
develops in semi desert regions mainly as a result of water erosion produced by violent
rain storms. The land is broken by extensive gullies and ravines which are separated
by steep ridges. Excellent examples of this type of desert occur in the region extending from
Alberta to Arizona.</p>

<h2>Features Produced by Wind Erosion</h2>
</div>

<div>
<p>Wind abrasion attacks rock masses and sculptures them into fantastic shapes. Some of
these, because of their shape are called rock pedestals.</p>
<h3>Rock pedestals </h3>
<p>Rocky mass formed of alternate rock layers of hard and soft rock. The abrasion is
greatest at ground level.</p>
<h3>Zeugens</h3>
<p>Wind abrasion turns a desert a desert area which has a surface layer of hard rock
underlain by a layer of soft rock into a ridge and furrow landscape. The ridges are called
zeugens which may be as high as 30 meters. Ultimately the are undercut and gradually worn
away.</p>
<h3>Yardangs</h3>
<p>Bands of hard and soft rocks which lie parallel to the prevailing winds in a desert
region are turned into another type of ridge and furrow landscape by wind and abrasion.
The belts of hard rock stand up as rocky ribs up to 15 meters high and they are fantastic
shapes Yardangs are very common in the central Asian desert and in the Atacama desert.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Depressions</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Some depressions produced by wind deflation reach down to water bearing rocks. A swamp
or an oasis then develops.</p>
<p>The Qattara depression is 122 meters (400 feet) below sea level. It has salt marshes
and the sand excevated from it forms a zone of dunes on the leeside</p>
<h3>Fault produced depressions</h3>
<p>The formation of a depression may first be caused by faulting. The soft rocks thus
exposed are excevated by wind action.
