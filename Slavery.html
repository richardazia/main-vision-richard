<h2>Slavery in the Roman empire!</h2>

<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will assume that you have already
heard about the Roman empire or have read other sources as to what slavery is. For those
who do need a definition slavery is the ownership and/or to force labour onto someone
without them being paid. You might be asking why the picture of the Sphinx and pyramids?
Well simply because I found a book named &quot;The Romans&quot; by Anthony Kamm which
gives that date leading me to want to show what slaves have accomplished over a time. If I
am not mistaken the Pyramid is Keops recognizable by what is left of the smoothened
surface. (sorry to digress). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the beginning of the empire
slavery was not so current but later on as more and more provinces were occupied enemies
were taken and sold as slaves. These ranged from Greeks to some barbarians. These
barbarians were used as labour in third empire. Greeks on the other hand were educated and
so were used to teach the Roman people about things. From this you can see how important
the slave was at the time.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slaves were a surplus to such an
extent that even slaves could own slaves of their own. The difference was that the
qualities of the slaves were different. For example a rich man could buy a slave which
would be able to rule his home and educate his children. The slave could then also own a
slave but this time for it's own use. This become common practice after the third century
BC (Source: &quot;Everyday life in Ancient Rome&quot; by F.R. Cowell. It is located in
chapter IV on slavery). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was due to the fact that the
Romans had a huge army consolidating the Roman empire and gaining submission from the
defeated countries. These people were then taken as slaves and so this is what caused the
great influx. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Cost of Slaves</h3>
<p>The cost of slaves could vary according to the
qualifications of the slave. If a slave was weak and could not do much work then he could
fetch very little or if it was a very capable slave which could do a lot then the cost was
high. Some people bought young untrained slaves which they trained to be able to sell the
slaves at a profit. Other slaves could be bought from a price of 500 denarii to 875,000.
This is a demonstration of the difference in wealth between slave owners (Form slaves to
rich masters). Slaves could buy their own slaves and sell them to their owners or keep
them to help them in the labour. Tariffs for slaves could be the following: a nurse and
two children could be sold for 1,800 denarii. The Romans admired beauty such that a pretty
girl could reach from 2000 to 6000 denarii. A music girl cost 4000 denarii. Later on in
the empire people were prepared to spend vast amounts on just a slave boy.  </p>

<h3>What work did they do in the provinces</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On farms the slaves had to take care
of the fields and also the houses of the owners. Some farms were family farms and so
didn't have many slaves as they could do it themselves. Rich farmers on the other hand
were able to get a lot of slaves which were qualified to take care of other problems The
rich farmer was a manager which had slaves to be the workers. Sometimes qualified slaves
were used as administrators since they had previous experience or the owner thought they
could be trusted.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other slaves were government owned.
Some ended up becoming gladiators while others had to do road works and other jobs. As I
have mentioned before the methods of construction I will assume that you have read that
too. Slaves had to work in&nbsp; the warm Mediterranean climate which at the time was
warmer. They had to carry the blocks of marble and other materials themselves on carts and
other transport methods.  </p>

<h3>How did they earn their freedom? </h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slaves could earn there freedom in a
number of ways depending on there role as a slave. Some slaves could get freedom
relatively easily compared to others. For example a qualified slave such as a Greek
serving in a rich man's house was treated with respect and was spared manual labour.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some other slaves on the other hand
were forced to do a lot of work on farms and in provincial work. They might have been
mistreated and beaten etc. They could get beaten and it would not be considered abusive
for the owner to do so. In farm work the farmer was said to have free tools with which to
work the land which are the following: The chariot for transport, the inarticulate such as
the oxen and those with voice such as the slaves. This tells us a little about the
situation which the slaves were in.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Combatant slaves such as gladiators
or chariot racers had to win their freedom in a much harsher way. The gladiator had to
confront vicious animals such as lions and other animals in an arena so that the Roman
citizens could entertain themselves. Gladiators were in a difficult position to get out of
as they had to fight valiantly and avoid to be killed and after a number of years without
been killed they earned the status of freedman.  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chariot racers had a very dangerous
job as they had to race horses on chariots which were frail and so disintegrated easily.
&nbsp; They had to tie the reigns of the horses around there chest so that they did did
were attached to the horses. In case of a crash they had to cut themselves loose fast or
they would be dragged along the floor and so die. They therefore carried a knife on them
in case of this eventuality. In both gladiator fights and chariot races the slaves could
earn a lot of money from bets on them. Slaves also had the possibility to buy their
freedom from their masters. </p>
<p>Conclusively people were not born into slavery but
instead were forced into it for a number of years after which they could be freedmen (<em>liberti</em>
in Latin) with land and slaves of their own.  </p>
