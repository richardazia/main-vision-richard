<p align="center"><strong><big>Have we come to an age where it is Survival of
the conformists, not the fittest?</big></strong></p>
<p>If we take a look at history we will see that dictatorships were set up in
most countries. From the civilisation of the Romans or Egyptians to modern day
China or even up to a leader which died recently, Pol Pot. Therefore since we
have created a basic framework for the essay it is possible to discuss whether
or not we have come to an age where it is &quot;Survival of the conformists.</p>
<p>The earliest type of conformist was slavery. Slavery was a form of
dictatorship which began very early on, maybe when language began or even when
tools could be used and people had needs, because of people's needs there are
some jobs which people don't want to do. this could for example be a
&quot;caveman&quot; telling his wife to hunt for berries. Another form is that
of slavery in the Egyptian civilisation where they built huge pyramids with
relatively little pay or reward. Here are two first type of conformists, wives
and women who have for generations gathered berries while men have hunted for
generations, the second is that of many people working on one project such as a
pyramid in order to serve as an Eternal tomb.</p>
<p>This type of conformist can also be seen in Stalinist Russia where men had to
obey the dictatorship in order to survive. A choice between life working for low
pay compared to life living in a gulag where conditions were rough and where
people were even irradiated after mining radioactive elements in Russia.</p>
<p>The worst type of conformists however are not those who are forced to work in
mines or be killed but those in today's western civilisation, children,
teenagers, and parents… basically everyone is affected in some way or other in
this tragic need to wealthier than others. When Karl Marx began with his idea
that police forces were hired thugs for the higher society, how precise was he?
Are they really hired thugs or is it peoples who are allowed to be human?
Therefore would it not be more accurate to call them warriors since they fight
for what they believe is right. What about the higher social classes? Simply
because they have these warriors does it mean that they too nonetheless conform
to what is expected of them?</p>
<p>After all of the literature that has been written about people not enjoying
being in the high social class such as Levin in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, is he
too not someone who is expected to conform, his friend Oblonsky is a proven
conformist in that he does whatever is expected of someone of his stature. What
about Kitty, what can be said about her? She is afraid that her parents will
become angry with or against her if she prefers Levin to the other character
whose name I've forgotten. Does this mean that she is an outward conformist
while within she is thinking about all that she is saying and doing. Is Levin
not considered a conformist since he goes to live in the countryside with the
poor while others despise the poor for there simple way of life? It is an
interesting question that we have asked ourselves here, however this is not the
aim of my thoughts so we will move on to higher ground.</p>
<p>This point I am talking about is of course School, much like social classes
it envelops in certain ideas we must obey in order to pass. I, myself, have once
witnessed an event which led me to the conclusion of this theory &quot;Survival
of the conformists&quot;. It is indeed a very complicated debate which I am
engaging myself into since there are so many points. What has triggered my
reaction to this is that I've received 3.5 in History when I have the background
knowledge that is required but because I came to a different conclusion it is
considered as being wrong. that is expected of me. The question was &quot;In
what ways were diplomatic efforts unable to prevent war in 1914&quot;. After
reading through many sources I came to the conclusion that the reason for this
was the fact that small countries in the Balkans disagreed with each other Since
they disagreed larger countries were dragged in. The correct answer of course
would have been to mention that world war I was caused by several powers such as
Russia mobilising and Germany reacting to it but I've come to believe that it
was the smaller states as indicated in my essay. Are any of us right? The
teacher, system, yet another factor, or me. The employer of the company for
which we will work? Can anyone answer that without being contradicted or
contradicting?</p>
<p>Another area that confuses me is fashion in schools, countries, continents
and other areas. Look at the film Titanic, was it such an excellent film that
everyone felt they should go to it or, to the contrary point of view did people
enjoy the plot, the suspense etc? After all there's already been a version of
that film made a few decades ago but which didn't have such success. Have tastes
changed in the movie going world or is more to the point that people conform to
their idles such as people conforming to Magic Johnson, All Saints, Spice girls
or even extremist parties as described when talking about Stalinism? Is that
conformist? Well, since it involves fear then it could be said that it is to a
very extensive point that they have no choice… but wait a moment, they do have
a choice, follow your leader or be punished. That's a choice which people don't
need to conform to unless they want to. Therefore anyone has a choice as to what
they do about something they dislike. Within school people can't be so simple
minded as saying that they don't want to follow the instructions but the teacher
does expect people to conform to these guidelines, therefore the school which
teachers say we should be so grateful to be going to is in fact not so great.
You don't have a choice as to how you want to respond to your essay except
follow the rules or face getting downgraded. In what way therefore can it be
considered an education? After all school is supposed to teach us to have a wide
view. That's the idea behind bad grades, saying that your idea is valid to such
an extent as to actually read it, but to what end? After all what is the point
of studying history and then not being allowed discussing your concepts. I felt
bitter for a while. The truth is that when you spend seven or more hours on
homework and then get a bad grade for it you don't feel the need to study as
hard since you haven't gained anything. In fact you've lost points which will be
hard to catch up.</p>
<p>How can a school be considered good when people are not to think but to
accept things as they are said to be? Also what is the point of going to a
school such as the international school of Geneva when you don't learn what you
want to but what you are told to. Why is it that after school and even in school
I can discuss such theories as I am discussing now when I'm supposed to be
tired. Am I abnormal because I enjoy thinking, am I in fact thinking? It doesn't
seem like it after all I can see what I'm typing at the same time as I'm
listening to Savage garden. Therefore what am I doing here? Why do I enjoy
thinking and finding answers while others hate it? Nerds are said to receive
good grades and spend a lot of time working but what about someone who enjoys to
think but doesn't get good grades in school? Therefore is this really an
effective way of teaching? Sitting in a class for hours on end wondering whether
the lesson will end or not because the teacher is boring and you are not
learning so much as it is sitting in a group listening. If you wanted to get
bored you could be sitting in a bus looking out of the window and feeling the
same amount of boredom, therefore is boredom a sign of learning or is it simply
a way to pass the time of day.</p>
<p>Another question, which could be asked, is about my e-mail friend Saara. I
don't write to her anymore and she hasn't answered my e-mail in quite some time.
What is curious is that while I was listening to Savage Garden earlier today I
was wondering about whether or not I knew her in person. However strange this
may seem to others when I read her e-mails I had the impression that I felt when
she was happy, sad, melancholic etc. I feel that I've got to know her well and
became a friend. But wait, How can she be a friend when I haven't met her? How
can I say that I hear her voice and can read her emotions when all I know about
her is that she lives far away from me and that I'll never meet her? Do I know
her any better than the girls I go to school with today or in fact better?</p>
<p>People say that she could have been lying about all her info etc. but after a
while of those lies and that person getting to know you they'll change their
stories to please you (at least I think they would. She didn't seem to do that
so was she truthful about herself? Was she the friend I never met but got to
know? In fact, will I find the same type of friendship within my own school or
within the area I live in?
