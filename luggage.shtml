  <h1>Luggage Handling </h1>
    <center><img src="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_0194-225x300.jpg" alt="Geneva airport passengers and luggage in 2016"></center>
 <p>For all those of you who take the plane and feel that it's a time consuming 
    and boring process (especially when flying frequently) there is a whole world 
    which you rarely see. </p> 
    <p>As a passenger you find it can be quite a struggle dealing with your 20 kilograms 
    of luggage and skies when coming over to Geneva for your winter holiday. At 
    the point when you leave your skies and go for a coffee or tea the skies are 
    entering into the world of luggage handling. </p></p>

  <h3>Container luggage</h3>
<p>This world is a complex world of destinations, transfers, containers, chariots, 
  lifts, ground crew, trains and more. </p>
<p>As the baggage is identified and enters the tri baggage (luggage sorting) every 
  single suitcase is passed through a system of platforms and transported to a 
  slide down which it goes waiting to be put into a container. There are several 
  containers around a team of luggage handlers and they read the label seeing 
  whether it is short stay, transfer, direct, first class and business, standby 
  or train. If they are standby and train it's simple, they sit there and the 
  barcode is checked to make sure that the client/passenger has checked in. Once 
  the passenger is checked in they are transferred to the appropriate location. 
  With normal luggage it goes into one container, business into another and first 
  class into a third. </p>

  <h3>Free luggage </h3>
<p>Free luggage as I will refer to it here is luggage for flights and aircrafts 
  where containers may not be used for the items. In this case each piece of luggage 
  is added to a chariot, one side where the cases are vertical and the other where 
  they are horizontal. Each of these chariots will hold around 2-300 kilos and 
  you may find from 10 to 15 chariots for just one aircraft depending on the wheight 
  of the luggage and how efficiently it is packed. In general this process can 
  last two hours, from the time the check in opens to the time you and your luggage 
  are boarding the plane. </p>

  <h2>Aircraft luggage handling</h2>
<h3>Unloading:</h3>
<p>Unloading aircrafts is a very good physical work out. Depending on the plane 
  you may be one or two people in the hold where you get very warm from the work. 
  You have a wall of luggage piled at least a meter high and several meters deep. 
  As you begin the work it's quite easy with the light bags higher in the stack 
  and the heavier near the bottom. This part of luggage handling is quite similar 
  to a giant game of tetris (although far heavier). Suitcases are usually at the 
  bottom as they create a base from which to pile the other luggage. Each piece 
  of luggage is placed parralel to the aircraft's body. It's several layers thick 
  and as you remove one wall you get to the next one and remove that one until 
  finally you reach the end and the aircraft is empty. In certain aircrafts you 
  find belly loading systems such as conveyor belts or trays from which you remove 
  the luggage. </p>

  <h3>Loading</h3>
<p>After the effort of unloading a plane we are now greeted by the fun or reloading 
  the plane with the outgoing luggage and this can be quite a tiring effort as 
  you are kneeling to lift bags which can be quite heavy. Depending on the aircraft 
  you will find yuo need to put the bags several meters deep into the plane and 
  start building piles of luggage. This is the most tiring and back breaking part 
  of aircraft loading because you have time constraints within which to create 
  your three dimensional tetris wall. From personal experience each chariot equals 
  to around one layer in the hold. Lifting the luggage in such space takes a lot 
  of strength and it's impossible to load a whole plane without using leverage 
  as far as possible. When suitcases need to be put higher up the knee is quite 
  good as a lever for lifting the suitcase and placing it within the available 
  space. When loading skies you will usually find that the skies and snowboards 
  are put either at the tail part of the plane or at the front depending on the 
  aircraft. They are piled up quite high and are treated seperately from the baggage.

<h3>Charter Luggage arrivals</h3>
<p>I worked at the charter arrivals at Geneva airport during around three hours 
  one day and the amount of planes landing and departing was quite impressive. 
  As each plane is unloaded by the ground crew by the aircraft the chariots are 
  then brought to the terminal building where they are passed from the chariot 
  towards the conveyor belt which takes the luggage to the clients waiting on 
  the other side of the wall. During this phase although it is quite intensive 
  it is not that hard physically, consisting mainly in taking luggage and putting 
  it down, in most cases just levering from chariot to conveyor efficiently to 
  keep the passengers happy. </p>
<p>Skies are usually pulled into the room where the people have retrieved their 
  luggage and it's quite amusing to see how they rush towards their skies, try 
  to get their skies and leave the rest on the floor for others to get theirs.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I enjoy working as a luggage handler although the work is very physically demanding. 
  It is a team of international people who joke and get tired together whilst 
  making sure you arrive and leave on time. When you see luggage handlers lying 
  on a chariot or sitting appearing to do nothing remember that they may have 
  just treated up to four tons of luggage in the last half hr or so. They/we are 
  not lazy and you'll see this from the muscle mass gained by these workers, of 
  which in winter, many are students doing the job for a little extra cash to 
  make life a little more comfortable. </p>
