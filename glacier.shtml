            <p>Moraine is a term used to describe the material which has been 
              carried and deposited at the end of it's route. There are three 
              variatons of moraine to remember. </p>
            <p>The first one is<b> terminal</b> moraine. These occur where the 
              glacier has ceased progressing forwards and deposited it's load 
              at the furthest point from it's starting position. </p>
            <p><b>Recessional</b> morain occur where the glacier has retreated 
              and slowed it's retreat to deposit more rock and material. </p>
            <p>Medial moraine can be found where two glaciers have converged into 
              one valley and between them deposited their load. </p>

            over the years and through it's rotational movement has hollowed out 
            and scoured the back wall to create a bowl like shape. At the back 
            a fairly steep wall can be found. </td>

    <div>
      <p>The term glaciation is used to describe the process which occurs when 
        ice accumulated into a large volume in one location from accumulated precipitation 
        over the years. In certain depressions the snow accumulates when the temperature 
        is too low for the snow to melt. Over the years the amount of ice increases 
        and with it the wheight of the volume of ice. This increasing mass begins 
        to exert on the soil below it and this pressure begins to erode the surface. 
        There may be a rotational movement which rips away rock smoothing the 
        formation and creating a cirque over time. A feature of the cirque is 
        firstly it's formation of a hollow but is recognisable by the rock face 
        behind it being quite steep.
      <p>Over time this may help to form a pyramidal peak such as the Materhorn 
        in Zermat or the Mt Blanc above Chamonix. The process continues down the 
        mountain with gravity's force with the result being the formation of a 
        glacier flowing down like a river. There are several key terms to remember 
        when talking of glaciers which you may find above.
      <p>When speaking of glacier it is interesting to remember that they behave 
        according to the same laws of fluid motion as a river. The center of the 
        glacier is moving faster than the outside because there is less friction 
        slowing it down. </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>It is one of the most destructive of geographic occurences 
        because of the sheer wheight contained within the ice. To illustrate the 
        movement of rock a simple experiment is to place several sticks at the 
        same height on the glacier and watch the movement of these sticks over 
        time. As the ice moves at different rates you will find that a v shape 
        is forming pointing downwards. It begins it's trip downwards and anything 
        in it's way is covered and surrounded by the ice over a period of time 
        and trapped. The material is ripped out of it's place even if it's a rock 
        as large as your house. It acts like sandpaper and leaves bare rock. 
      <p>What remains from the passage of a glacier is a U shaped valley as can 
        be seen by the Lac Leman (lake Geneva) in Switzerland. Boulder clay which 
        is the ground stone is ubiquitous within the region and a rich soil is 
        a possitive side effect of all the materials which have been moved. 
      <p>The speed of the glacier is not constant as you may be led to believe. 
        It is dependant on various factors such as precipitation, temperature, 
        angle of the slope and more. As the temperature increases the glacier 
        slows down and may begin to retreat. Precipitation helps add material 
        and mass which give the glacier enough momentum to begin flow back down 
        the slope. Finally the aspect of the slope may affect speed since the 
        steeeper it is the faster it will move down hill.
