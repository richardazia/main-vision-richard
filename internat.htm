      <h1>International treaties governing trade in Endengared Species</h1>
        <h3>Introduction:</h3>
          <p>There are three ways to put wildlife conservation on a legal footing.</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Establish laws for individual species and establish laws for a small group of species</li>
              <li>Establish a treaty for a particular region</li>
              <li>Establish a World Wide Treaty</li>
            </ol>
<h3>CITES:</h3>
<p>Conservation on international trade in Endangered Species (of Wilf Fauna and Flora)</p>
<p><a href="https://cites.org/" target="blank">CITES</a> was signed since 1973 and now there are over 110 nations who have signed. It
prohibits International commercial trade in the rarest 600 species of animals and plants
and requires licences from the country of origin for export of about another 200 groups.
<a href="https://cites.org/" target="blank">CITES</a> deals with the problem of widespread, illegal trade of the threatened species.</p>
<p>The ligitimate trade is worth billions of dollars per year and although the illegal
trade has been cut back by <a href="https://cites.org/" target="blank">CITES</a> it is still a big business. For example Japan still
imports huge amounts of tortoise shells, crocodile skins, musk and more wildlife products
although they have signed <a href="https://cites.org/" target="blank">CITES</a>.</p>
<h3>The Biodiversity treaty Convention:</h3>
<p>This was signed by almost all countries except the USA at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio,
this convention is mostly a deal giving Western countries access to biological resources
(for ex. chemicals and genes from wild plants) in return for them transferring money and
technical assistance towards the conservation and sustainable use of wild areas in the
south.</p>
<h3>The convention on Wetlands of International Importance (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsar_Convention">Ramsar convention</a>)</h3>
<p>This convention was signed by 64 countries. There are 542 wetland sites that have been
included in the Convention's list of Wetlands of International importance, signed in the
1970's. </p>
