<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves, a weekly article</h1>
<h2>1st Page 2000</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful free html editing softwares I have found is 
              first page 2000 by <a href="http://www.evrsoft.com">EVRsoft</a>. 
              If you're tired of using frontpage which always loses your navigation 
              and adds so many extra tags why not begin experimenting with 1st 
              page 2000. It is very intuitive to use and although it may be a 
              little bit of a challenge dealing with the html code it soon becomes 
              habit.</p>
            <p>It has four modes, easy, expert, hardcore and normal. Although at the 
              beginning you may use the easy mode after refreshing your coding 
              memory you can use the other modes depending on your level of comfort. 
              Interesting features are the code assistants for when creating tables, 
              asp scripts and more. A feature which I find quite useful is the 
              feature for setting up images to display properly with an alternative 
              text and more.</p>
            <p>One of 
              the strong points about the software is that you can work on several 
              pages at once. This speeds up the process when creating navigation 
              within the site. If you're used to coding then using the server 
              side includes (SSI) are very interesting when creating the site 
              navigation but that is another topic. In continuing on this it means 
              that if you've decided that you want to change code but haven't 
              used the SSI yet then it is one of the best softwares to do so. 
              I particularly enjoyed using this software because as a piece 
              of freeware it is very powerfull and you are in full control of 
              the layout of your site. </p>
            <p>Although this software has many good sides one of 
              the drawbacks which I have encountered is the lack of a wysiwyg 
              option to edit directly onto the page itself. It would make certain 
              tasks more simple, for example when there is an error in code being 
              taken straight there is more interesting as in Dreamweaver. Another 
              element which could be improved is the ability to upload directly 
              to your server rather than having to use a second program. </p>
            <p>Apart from the software side the <a href="http://developers.eversoft.com">website</a> 
              associated with this product is full of useful tools for webmasters 
              such as PHP, ASP, style sheets and many other more specific options.
