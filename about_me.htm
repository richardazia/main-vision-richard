  <td>I am currently working on becoming a camera operator/editor in Switzerland although I am ready to travel where the work takes me.&nbsp; Recently <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardazia/">I worked</a> for the International Labour Organisation as a cameraman/editor for the International Labour conference which was held in Geneva at the United Nations. 
                During the weeks since then I have been working on videos for a dance school in Geneva for teaching traditional dancing. Having 
                spent a week at the <a href="tc2003.shtml">Telecom 2003</a> I am waiting for my next work experience. 2003 has been a good year and I'm impatient for 2004</td>

  <td><h2>Interests and hobbies</h2></td>
  <td> Living in Switzerland gives a vast 
                choice of activities, from snowboarding and skiing in winter to 
                swimming, cycling and hiking in summer. A few weeks ago I spent 
                a few evenings sailing on Lake Geneva (Lac LÃ©man) for some races. 
                <p>Apart from sports I am interested in new technologies, whether 
                  on the web, mobile phones and more.&nbsp;

  <td><h2>Ambitions</h2></td>
  <td >Within the next few months I hope to 
                build up a network of contacts whom may help me in getting enough 
                work to be self sufficient. As time continues beyond the next 
                few months towards the next five years I hope to establish myself 
                as being good at what I do so that I may enjoy my work and live 
                a comfortable life.</td>
