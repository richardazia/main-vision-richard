 <h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1> 
        <h2>Orkut and internationalism</h2>
        <p>A few years ago a website inspired from a film attempted to demonstrate 
          how each person around the world was spread through six degrees of connectivity 
          or less. The thought was that everyone knows everyone else through only 
          six other people. That is to say that my friend knows some people that 
          I don't know and they know even more people and so it goes on. The idea 
          was that only six peoples in depthfor these relations would associate 
          you with everyone.</p>
        <p>Sixdegrees comes in because people signed up themselves and invited 
          their friends to join. As more and more people joined the connections 
          became more complex and more and more people were associated via this 
          network. Overtime everyone would have been linked. Unfortunatley this 
          project dissapeared under the waves of data. </p>
        <p>Recently it has re-surfaced into my group of friends but under a different 
          name. It is now called <a href="http://www.orkut.com">Orkut</a> and 
          is dependent on people knowing other people to make the list grow, based 
          on invitations rather individuals signing up. This was in the hope that 
          everyone would be linked to at least one person. </p>
        <p>These experiments are interesting because we live in a time of relative 
          isolation. We are able to find people to chat to from all over the world 
          quite easily and most of the people on our messenger lists we have never 
          met. We have taken the physical act of meeting and associating with 
          others into a virtual realm. What interests me is the cause for this 
          movement away from one thing towards another. Is the reason we're moving 
          online due to social factors like longer working days, longer commutes 
          to meet friends and more? Are you becoming a more global and international 
          society where the only way to keep in touch with friends is through 
          online means?</p>
        <p>I enjoy going out every night to meet friends, spend time with them 
          talking about many different topics, being sociable. It can be quite 
          a challenge finding people with whom to spend time during the week. 
          It seems most people are too tired and unwilling to socialise to link 
          up. Why is it that our best friends are no longer living in the same 
          country as us anymore. Are social interactions becoming something quite 
          different. </p>
        <p>Tomorrow I will be back in Switzerland meeting my friends who live 
          in Switzerland, enjoying their company, enjoy the bars, restaurants 
          and more which I've grown a part of. I will no longer require the world 
          wide web or communication technologies to communicate as I will be there 
          in person. I may be able to encourage more people to join Orkut, to 
          become part of a network of people who know others having more than 
          one link. </p>
        <p>As I have seen although I am a member of Orkut and have invited some 
          friends so far none have decided to join. I will attempt to invite more 
          friends and see whether these decide to join when they have time. It's 
          an interesting idea and I'd like to be a more active member but this 
          depends on how strong the friendships are in the real world and whether 
          I can interest people in becoming a part of it.</p>
