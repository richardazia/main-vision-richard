        <h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Computers playing with our Emotions</h2>
        <h3>Premiere 6.5, windows 98 and the DV200</h3>
        <p>How many of us have had the misfortune of having work 
          and losing it? Spending a lot of time video editing I have become used 
          to having problems and finding solutions to those problems. Quite recently 
          a new card has been isntalled on my computer so that I may use more 
          hard drives at once. The problem is that due to the new card being put 
          into the computer it kept crashing and something had to be done about 
          that. The operating system was re-installed and with the re-installation 
          there has been a problem with the codecs to the best of my understanding. 
          There are now a few hours of de-bugging to understand what the problem 
          is, whether hardware or software. </p>
        <p>The emotional toll for that type of problem is quite high 
          as you may imagine. As is commonly known video is to some extent an 
          art form and when you finish an edit and really enjoy it it's always 
          best to save a backup whether on the hard disk as an avi file or as 
          an other file format as I have done. Quite a few times as a video production 
          student I have seen student's work being lost either through negligence 
          on their part, incompatibilities between different versions of the same 
          program, changes in hardware within the computer, hard disk crashes 
          and finally operating system re-installations. </p>
        <h3>Front page versions</h3>
        <p>Whilst working with front 
          page for webmastering many times I have found that the software has 
          played with my emotions in a number of ways. Firstly every time that 
          you create a page within frontpage 2000 it contributes a huge amount 
          of code which is not essential for the page to display. Furthermore 
          to this it is going against the w3c organisation regulations whereby 
          it may not display properly in all browsers. </p>
        <p>The navigation structure within 
          frontpage 2000 is also quite buggy because when a project is exported 
          from one machine to another it is lost and if you work on your site 
          from the web the site is still not behaving the way it should and navigation 
          structures are occasionaly lost completely and the joyous activity of 
          building it back to it's original state may begin.</p>
        <p>Finally the part which I found 
          was most dissapointing with Frontpage is the amount of extra files it 
          needs to run. If those files could be removed then the website would 
          be far smaller on the server and only the necessary files for the site's 
          proper functioning would be present.</p>
        <p>As I got tired of that problem I've experimented with 1stpage 2000 
          which is an excellent free software. </p>
        <p>Hope to add more with time, if you'd like to share your 
          own misfortunes then don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:richard@main-vision.com?subject=%22contribute%20to%20surfing%20pages%22">contact
