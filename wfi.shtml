<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>WIFI</h2>
        <p>For those of you who enjoy having access from anywhere in your home 
          WIFI is a very interesting option. As it becomes more affordable to 
          purchase it is now possible to have a home with access to the World 
          Wide Web and the Internet from anywhere. Imagine that you're in the 
          kitchen preparing a meal and you've found sites with information about 
          the meal you'd like to prepare. Rather than having to print out the 
          document or going to the computer room to get the information simply 
          bring the laptop to your kitchen and type your request. </p>
        <p>It's a radio technology working at around 2.4 GHz with a variety of 
          standards of which 802.11b provides access at 11 Mbytes per second.Add 
          to this ADSL and you've got a very interesting tool for surfing the 
          world wide web. It requires only cables from the modem to the transmitter 
          which can be an external device which servs as an AP or use a card from 
          your desktop to give Internet access throughout the home and towards 
          the garden. For bussinesses and schools this is quite a good technology 
          to use because there will be no need for hundreds of meters of cable 
          for every user. Instead you'll have access anywhere as long as you've 
          got a receiver on the machine you want to use. In schools and businnesses 
          there will be the need for this technology as more and more of the resources 
          will be made available through the intranet and world wide web. </p>
        <p>In Public places such as the exhibition halls for the <a href="http://www.telecom2003.ch">Telecom 
          2003</a> or <a href="http://www.gva.ch">Geneva International Airport</a> 
          WIFI access has been made available to the public for a certain user 
          fee. This means that whilst waiting for a plane or doing business you 
          don't need to hunt for an access point as it's all around you. If you're 
          waiting for your flight you still have access to your favourite discussion 
          forums, news websites, e-mail etc. In some ways this technology will 
          enable the use of Internet technologies to cope with an ever expanding 
          list of possibilities for internet use.</p>
        <p>Because of it's nature WIFI may be used in a cellular method, such 
          as can be seen by today's GSM technology. If you're covering a floor 
          then you may need an access point to cover most of the floor but some 
          regions may have poor signal strength due to the human bodies abosrbing 
          the radiowaves or microwaves scrambling the signal. In so doing access 
          can be chosen according to whether it's a floor, a building or an area. 
          In Geneva airport for example you may find that the wifi technology 
          is available in each room and that each room has an access point to 
          provide coverage. In the case of a large building, for example at telecom 
          2003 then you may find that several access points are spread around 
          the exhibition halls. </p>
        <p>Another element of WIFI technology is that depending on the amount 
          of users on a single cell there may be a need to resize the access to 
          smaller cells when there is high demand so that each user has the strongest 
          signal. Depending on whether the user is mobile or not, for example 
          in a car, the need for the cells to overlap will be quite evident. In 
          overlapping the cells it should be possible to move from one cell to 
          another whilst maintaining the ability to work. </p>
        <p>One of the most important elements of WIFI technologies is that their 
          advantage with high speed access from anywhere is possible it also means 
          that your security may be compromised if you have no firewall setup 
          or that others will use your internet link from the parking outside 
          your building. There are several methods of protecting your company 
          such as making sure that you block the signal for example. Remember 
          that anyone can setup an access point and that by setting up their access 
          point they can fool your computer in connecting to them. If such things 
          happen and if your data is intercepted then it's possible that they 
          see all your information, including UBS data for example. </p>
        <p>WIFI is great for surfing the World Wide Web and visiting sites of 
          interest or moving various files from one terminal to another but when 
          dealing with e-banking etc. it's better to depend on your classic lan 
          cables where you know they're plugged in. </p>
        As an example of a setup take the <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KDVI/perspectives">Linksys 
        WRT54G Wireless-G Router</A> as an access point and use <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00007KDVK/perspectives">Linksys 
        WPC54G Wireless-G Notebook Adapter</A> for your for your laptop and the 
        whole setup costs less than $200
