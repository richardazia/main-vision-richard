<h1>About the fall of the Roman empire</h1>

  <p><b>Socially</b> (this I'm only guessing
  at):&nbsp; At the time of Rome's weakening, their was an increasingly widening
  gap between the plebian and patrician classes do to the poverty of the
  plebians and the extreme richness of the patricians.&nbsp; This cause for
  social conflicts and a fall in the plebians morale who were, of course, the
  majority.&nbsp; When the government saw this, they created a huge number of
  holidays ( somewhere in the upper 100's) throughout the year and made such
  places for public amusement such as the coliseum ( they also had huge mass
  orgies...but let's not go there!)&nbsp; This created for a general loss of
  patriotism in the populace, and a loss of contact with the ruling class
  through the wide gap between the classes, and a lack of confidence in the now
  faltering Roman Empire.</p>

  <p> <b>Politically</b>:&nbsp; Rome,
  had become to great and vast for it's own good.&nbsp; Their empire had swelled
  to proportions which it's government was unable to effectively control.&nbsp;
  With the encroaching and increasingly brazen attacks of Germanic tribes from
  the west, Rome needed complete and swift control, and this it lacked.</font>
  <p>&nbsp;

  <p><b>Militarily</b>:While Rome possessed a brilliant war machine, they, in a political attempt to strengthen
  control, halved their military abilities&nbsp; with the division of Rome into
  east and west empires.&nbsp; Also, the instability of the weakening Roman
  empire, and lack of great leaders, resulted in a loss of morale, or more
  accurately, fighting spirit.&nbsp; Soldiers were no longer fighting for the
  glory of the empire, they were fighting for wages, and those were not much at
  all and certainly not to die for.</font>

  <p><b>Economically</b>
  Another situation, like the political/geographic scenario, where Rome became
  perhaps, too good.&nbsp; Rome's wealthy patricians spent exorbitant fees to
  foreign sources to decorate their homes, and buy their foods, and fund their
  parties.&nbsp; As happens with many empires, their gold leaves the country
  through an imbalance of trade.&nbsp; Rome was slowly draining of it's wealth</font>
