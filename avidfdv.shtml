<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Avid Free DV</h2>
      <p>Video has come a long way since the days of Dziga Vertov. In his day 
        the cutting room would have been filled with strips of film being assembled 
        into sequences which gained a new meaning. Overtime with tape and then 
        digital editing techniques like Avid for example editing has become a 
        far simpler and creative process. The prices have also gone down making 
        the whole act of editing far more democratic. </p>
      <p>
        For a while <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AJXWP/perspectives?creative=125581&camp=2321&link_code=as1" target="_blank">Adobe 
        Premiere</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005TRYQ/perspectives?creative=125577&camp=2321&link_code=as1%20" target="_blank">Finalcut 
        pro</a> were the cheaper more affordable solution for home users, but 
        that was in the days of the miro dc 30+ where after spending three days 
        editing you realise you can't export your project, the hard disks crash 
        and you cry in sadness for the loss of a creative work. </p>
      <p>
        Recently whilst surfing I found something which really made me happy. 
        Anyone with a powerful machine, who runs windows XP can have one of the 
        most powerful editing tools on the market. Avid. </p>
      <p>
        It is a less souped up version, only capable of DV editing but for any 
        student of montage this is the perfect tool to learn from. It's free and 
        that's wonderful when you think of it's usual price. </p>
      <p>
        Of course we all know why <a href="http://www.avid.com">Avid</a> has decided 
        to do this. It's firstly because students like to use pirated software 
        since they feel it's owed to them but also because by offering <a href="http://www.avid.com/freedv/">Avid 
        Free DV</a> to anyone they are increasing their potential client list. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For the actual software it works exactly the same way as Avid Media Composer 
        or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000AJXWP/perspectives?creative=125581&camp=2321&link_code=as1" target="_blank">Avid 
        Xpress</a> so the move from the free software to the professional should 
        be without any hardships on the part of the user. </p>
      <p>
        I recommend you download this software and use one of the most interesting 
        editing tools I know on the market. </p>
