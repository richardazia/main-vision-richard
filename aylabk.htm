  <h2>Some thoughts on Jean M Auel's book series about &quot;Earth's Children&quot; 
  </h2>
</div>
<p>Jean M. Auel who is the creator of the Earth's chidlren series detailing the 
  life that a woman may have lived several thousand years before our own time 
  period is a very interesting author. Through extensive research into early man 
  from the stone age we are introduced into a world we may never have known otherwise. 
  Her main character Ayla whose family have been killed by an earthquake mean 
  that as a small child Ayla is left to die. Luckily a less evolved version of 
  our own species comes and takes care of her. She is taught how to behave within 
  a society where women deal with one part of daily life and men are set towards 
  another part of life. Through time she becomes more accustomed to the culture 
  within which she is living and becomes a medecine woman. </p>
<p>Because of her nature she gets into trouble because she teaches herself to 
  hunt, something deeply taboo for the people of the cave. As an addition to this 
  she drinks from a bowl of substance which has adverse effects on her, changing 
  forever Creb, the man of her hearth. After having a child and surviving a death 
  curse an earthquake occurs and she is bannished from these people. </p>
<p>She goes towards a valley where she lives for several years during which time 
  she learns how to sing like the birds, hunt by herlsef and even make animals 
  tame and do what she would like. In so doing the author of the series of books 
  creates an interesting individual through which we may understand the way in 
  which our own way of life became more complex. Through this author's understanding 
  of early man we are brought to a time before many of the daily luxuries we now 
  have and this is a far simpler way of life where it is lived from day to day 
  rather than from week to week. </p>
<p>She explores the creating of certain new technologies being discovered by accident, 
  such as faster methods of creating fire, methods of shooting two stones from 
  a sling in rapid succesion rather than a single stone and at the same time exploring 
  the system of beliefs which these people may have had without all the knowledge 
  we have. In her exploration on how man may have found out the secrets of pottery 
  etc. she is actually creating a book about how man become who he is today.</p>
<p>With the symbolism of the Earth Mother and travel we learn two things, firstly 
  about the importance of respecting the envionment within which these people 
  lived thousands if not millions of years ago but at the same time we also see 
  the importance that travel and the sharing of ideas can bring to people of the 
  world. I can't help but hink that this series is not simply about early man 
  and how he could have lived but is also exploring who we are today, why we dislike 
  something which we view as different. The examples of this are Echozar and other 
  members who are a mixture of the two people of this time. It is showing racial 
  conflict as it still exists today whilst at the same time possibly exploring 
  the conflict between our vision of someone deformed and whether they are truly 
  deformed or whether it is an error in judgment on our part. </p>
<p>Through reading her books I feel that my view of the world has evolved from 
  one which used to think as far possible as possible into the future and about 
  technology, about how advanced we are when there is the possiblity that the 
  society of people living several thousand years ago may have been just as valid 
  and interesting as the way of life which we have today. I would recommend anyone 
  to read this series of books as I have found that they are a very interesting 
  read. </p>
