<h3>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h3>
        <h1>Telecom 2003 summary</h1>
        <p>During the last Telecom show in 1999 the Telecom's industry was in 
          full expansion because of excitement which had been created by the idea 
          that the World Wide Web and the Internet could be used as a good means 
          of making money. During this honeymoon phase of expansion billions of 
          dollars were invested in servers, infrasctructure and more without much 
          co-operation between businesses. The infrascrtucture which was created 
          soon found that it was useless because the amount of data being transferred 
          was less than the capacity made available to the content providers. 
          As a result of this many companies which had borrowed vast amounts of 
          money went bankrupt. </p>
        <p>During this period of time many of the content providers decided to 
          merge and become gigantic mega-corporations because this was seen as 
          a great way to increase the amount of content available. The amount 
          which went into aquisitions was an over-investment resulting in huge 
          amounts of debt. for the companies. As they imploded a major panick 
          ensued within which people began to distrust the World Wide Web and 
          the Internet's possibilities. </p>
        <p>The importance of Telecom 2003 was the lessons learned by the various 
          companies which are exhibiting. Instead of concentrating on offering 
          cable services from everywhere to everywhere money is invested more 
          wisely in projects such as that by <a href="http://www.voisin-voisine.ch">Voisin 
          Voisine</a>, a fiber to the home project by the <a href="http://www.lake-geneva.net/Telecom/FHomePageTelecom.aspx?tokenPage=4bv0VjdqMEQ29M3rxIO20tjtGjD6hMECq-4ShkX2dfI))">Service 
          Industriel de Gen√®ve</a>. This project is aiming to provide 10Mb/s 
          to a group of flats in Charmilles to see how well it is taken up. Also 
          taking place is the creation of at least 300 hotspots in Switzerland 
          for WI-FI communications so that the web can be accessed from a variety 
          of locations. </p>
        <p>At Telecom 2003 two of the main concepts were outsourcing and convergance. 
          With servers and staff costing a lot of money for individual organisations 
          to create a good online environment it is better to get various smaller 
          companies to specialise in what they offer. In so doing money is spent 
          far more wisely and a stable working environment is being formed for 
          people working in telecommunications. </p>
        <p>In Conclusion one of the most important points is that whilst a lot 
          of excitement was around during the 1999 Telecom show in 2003 people 
          understand the medium much better and are now creating valid and effective 
          frameworks by which to create an internet based money making environment.</p>
