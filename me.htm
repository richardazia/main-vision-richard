    <p align="center">Being me is an interesting thing to be, you see me is
    another way of saying Richard, now Richard is an interesting person because
    of many things...&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center">and now for a change of style</p>
    <p align="left">Several years ago, around 54 to be a little more concise
    there was a war going on, second World War. The Allies were trying to oust
    an insecure prick from his post as leader of Germany, they had been trying
    to attempt this ever since he invaded Poland. This followed the somewhat
    stupid idea that appeasmant was the way to go.</p>
    <p align="left">How wrong that was</p>
    <p align="left">England was seperated from the European continent at the
    time, channel tunnel was not created yet and it was a strategic point from
    which to launch a second attack, the first being from North Africa through
    Italy.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Thousands of troops assembled in England and somehow had to
    get onto ships in order to launch an attack, they had to find a strategic
    place, this place is where I am at the moment. Weymouth was at one time
    quite an important port, known for it's shipping, fishing and of course King
    Edward III (right king I hope) coming to swim here starting a crazy new
    style, sunbathing... wow two important occurences in one part of the
    world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">This is relevant to anyone visiting my site because this is
    my new point of study, Weymouth College, studying video production at the
    Higher National degree, surrounded by many people at least one year older
    than me.</p>
    <p align="left">The clubbing life leaves a little to be desired, find that
    many people go out to get sloshed so that most conversations are fairly
    superficial thereby killing the philosopher within anyone, secondly the
    booze which is cheaper than in Switzerland but more expensive than in Crete
    does not get you slammed, just merry...&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">Dancing is sometimes good, depends on your mood and so on,
    found the best night so far was with a multinational group, that is to say
    out of four people seven nationalities, one from Tunis, one from Macedonia,
    on from Turkey and one from Switzerland (of English, Italian and Polish
    decent *the hero of this account*)</p>
    <p align="left">There's a slight lack of things to do here during the day
    apart from go shopping for cd's etc. etc while waiting to start serious <a href="http://www.divedorset.com">diving</a>
    in this part of the world.</p>
    <p align="left">Oh yeah, people are so cold here, in Switzerland you meet
    girls you know and you greet them with a kiss, here you do the same and it's
    considered a come on... strange these britishers who only club two am... and
    who don't want to go snowboarding at 2am!!! Why can't you go snowboarding at
    2am... there's nothing better to do</p>
    <p align="left">well Remember dear friend that shit happens in miraculous
    ways</p>
          <p align="left">*warning if you're below legal swearing age please don't 
            read the line above... shame the warning is directly after*</p>
