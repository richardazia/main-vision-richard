  <p><b>Birth of a website:</b>
  <p>In 1996 after having spent two weeks in the Ardeche I came 
    home and felt bored. I decided that to fill up my time I would begin to write 
    about the Roman civilization until my document was several thousands of words 
    long. It is around this time that the World Wide Web was becoming more important. 
    I remember the news reader one night saying that the World Wide contained 
    six million pages at the time. I uploaded the site towards my father's domain 
    at Iprolink which was our ISP at the time. </p>
  <p><b>Gorwing up:</b></p>
  <p>As time went on and I had my one hundredth hit to the site 
    I felt a little scared that so many people had seen it. After a while though 
    this turned into interest and I began to look at various free hosting sites 
    such as geocities before it was taken over by Yahoo. At this time geocities 
    was a community of people creating websites about their interests. As time 
    evolved I found out about webrings (before yahoo took them over as well) and 
    other services. I spent many hours on seeing what others were doing and found 
    that there were a few awards sites of which I have at least two. </p>
  <p><b>Getting noticed:</b> </p>
  <p>Over a period of around a year to a year and a half I spent 
    almost every day doing research into search engines and how to get the site 
    noticed. Over time as meta tags etc. were added my website began to generate 
    more and more traffic until finally there were at least one to two thousand 
    hits a day. People came from all over the world and it was interesting to 
    notice certain of the countries. </p>
  <p><b>Size:</b></p>
  <p>At the moment the website contains over a hundred and fifty 
    pages divided into five main headings. It includes real media, quicktime and 
    windows media player video files for a variety of connection speeds from 56k 
    up to broadband access. In all this website contains around 221 images. Without 
    counting the videos there are around 7 megabytes of content for your viewing 
    pleasure. </p>
  <p><b>Projects:</b> </p>
  <p>I am in the process of re-working the website so that it 
    will generate more hits and be a useful resource to students and people fascinated 
    by the Roman civilization, interested in the Romans, new technology etc. and 
    I'm also working on adding a part to the site which would allow me to generate 
    enough money to live off whilst looking for work within the media. </p>
