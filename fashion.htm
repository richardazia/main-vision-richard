<p>For several weeks some people within my grade had been organising a fashion
show and I was asked to shoot it, I was a little disappointed when I arrived
there and found that there were metal girders in the way so that I could not be
offset from the stage therefore having to be in the back of the room pointing
towards the catwalk.</p>
<p><strong>Intro</strong></p>
<p>During my summer holidays in Rome at Piazza di Spagna in Rom, Italy was a
fashion show which took many different cameras, from heavy studio cameras to
cameras attached to balloons with jibs, steadycam etc. giving very good coverage
of the show. In comparison I had very little when I shot the fashion show, a
PC7, a manfrotto tripod as well as a power adaptor to power the camera.</p>
<p><strong>Shooting the show</strong></p>
<p>Shooting the show was hard because I only had one camera and one take so that
if I messed up I lost the shot. I worked on getting shots of the people on stage
doing their movements keeping wider shots so as to try not to miss anything and
I got a fairly high success rate although there are some mistakes which I would
like to add here so that people may learn something</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>How I worked on shooting the video</strong></p>
<p>The first mistake I made was to use the PC7 since I needed to zoom in on a
light, lock the auto exposure so that most of the show was at one exposure
therefore I may have used the zoom at inappropriate moments to get an exposure
ruining a shot but when this was locked I profited from this because the show
was at the same intensity throughout so that if I had needed to do a five minute
edit rather than a whole show edit there would have been no problem in using the
shots.</p>
<p>The second point here which was annoying was the way it was set up, there was
the central ramp as well as wings coming out like a square plane shape. This
caused a problem because sometimes people went directly to the front element of
the stage while others stopped at the first section so that I found that I had
to zoom out to accommodate the shot size and with the zoom on the PC7 being very
sensitive I found that there was a rapid zoom out messing up the shot. I don't
know whether using the VX-1E may have helped as it is manual but this tended to
be a problem, the second part where it may have been useful is for the exposure
but that was one less thing to fiddle with therefore it was an advantage.</p>
<p>Other than that I would have liked a second camera for the show so that while
one concentrated on getting wide shots the second one could get tighter shots,
eg. moving up and down to show the clothes or showing the people's expressions.</p>
<p><strong>Editing</strong></p>
<p>This is an important moment when working on videos since until then we hope
we have some useful material and luckily for this edit most of the material was
of acceptable quality, there were a few zoom jerks and bad shots but overall I
was able to edit and keep the material and the first few minutes were bad
because I did not have experience with the situation but as the show progressed
there was more material which did not need cutting.</p>
<p>This video was one which was more for the memory of doing the show than for
the actual show and the girls who organised it wanted the whole show but for the
commercial aspect I edited the video down a little (If it was a five minute
video it would be excellent) so that the show remained on the tape removing bad
shots such as when the presenters were speaking and cutting directly to the next
strut down the catwalk.</p>
<p>Music on the DV tape was good and I counted to a certain extent on people
enjoying the music while looking at the video giving it a more dynamic feeling.</p>
<p>Dubbing the edit onto VHS is where the quality loss occurred and the sound
too going from DV to VHS.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing the video</strong></p>
<p>In order to sell my video I worked in several ways, firstly before the
fashion show the organisers had asked for a copy which I would pass them and
later at the actual show some parents asked for copies of the show so I gave
them my contact information so that when I had edited the video they may buy a
copy. After this I sold my first copy to one of the people in it and getting an
advance on the money.</p>
<p>After the show was edited and I had sold a few copies I made some more copies
which I sold by going to ask people whether they wanted a copy and although I
did not sell many at the point when I am writing this I hope to sell at least 10
more.
