<p>During my time in England as a student on a video production course a friend
of mine had quite an extensive martial arts video library and over a period of
time I enjoyed many of the films of which many can be found below.&nbsp;</p>

This is a Hong Kong film starring Jet Li as Wong Fei-hun who is fighting for the
      rights of his people whom are being sent as slaves to California. At the
      same time he must save his Aunt from Chinese forces coming into conflict
      with the slave traders armed with firepower.</td>

      of Fury</a></td>
    <td width="629" height="114">Beginning with a beautiful sword display this
      film is one of my favorites. Based on a warrior whom is living a calmer
      life but is encouraged by a minor government official to become more
      active. In so doing he becomes a target himself.&nbsp;
      <p>All in all the film's characters are very interesting and honor plays
      an important in this particular film. The fight choreography is also worthwhile
      with particularly interesting moments.&nbsp;</td>

    <td width="629" height="91">Drunken Master starring Jackie Chan as the rebellious
      son of a Kung Fu master is sent to see So Hi whom is another
      Kung Fu master. He begins training with this master and at the beginning
      the treatment looks harsh but as the film progresses we see the value of
      the &quot;Drunken&quot; style of Kung Fu. The level of the martial arts
      are astounding and there are many moments of comedy interspersed
      throughout the movie.&nbsp;</td>

    <td width="629" height="-2">China is smuggling drugs into Paris and Liu Jian,
      an undercover Chinese cop finds himself in trouble and running from the
      law whilst trying to reset the status quo. The play between Jet Li and
      Bridget Fonda add a more human feel to the movie allowing for a more
      balanced film.
      <p>There are some good fight sequences and it's refreshing to see Paris in
      a movie.&nbsp;</td>
