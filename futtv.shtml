<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>The future of Television Viewing</h3>
        <p>Sitting at home alone when the snow is building up there's nothing 
          better than staying in the house, flicking through the channels and 
          looking at television progams we could watch. Of course this flicking 
          through the television programs is of a different nature. What I was 
          doing was looking at the electronic programme guide, a place where all 
          programs are scheduled according to channel and program type. </p>
        <p>Over time the selection was complete and the portable video recorder 
          (digital satelite receiver) was ready for the task I had set it. Over 
          the next few hours whilst I was downstairs the machine recorded all 
          the listed programs onto the hard disk giving me a choice of many programs 
          to watch at a slightly later time of the day. No longer was aI chained 
          to the television and the program schedule, rather I was tasting the 
          future of television. </p>
        <p>For years the idea of video on demand has been discussed and the possibility 
          of having hundreds of channels has also been the dream of many people. 
          Over the past few months and especially over the past week I have been 
          taking full advantage of this technology, recording films for later 
          viewing, watching documentaries and more. All these videos were watchable 
          on demand.</p>
        <p>It's an interesting environment where we have the freedom to create 
          our own television schedule. If we want to watch a little frasier, followed 
          by documentaries on aviation followed by a wide diversity of programs 
          we control our entire viewing experience, even to the extent of skipping 
          through boring adverts, but occasionaly letting those adverts we have 
          not seen yet play out. </p>
        <p>This is the futrue of television, far more interactive, and with a 
          lot of progress to be made. As the hard disks become larger and more 
          programing can be stored more and more people will take advantage to 
          tailor their viewing experience. Not only are we coming to a time of 
          narrow casting but we are also coming to the age of television personalisation. 
        </p>
        <p>This is a necessity in today's world, after all why would we want to 
          have to wait till 6pm for a program to start when we arrive home at 
          7pm? Who wants to sit through adverts when with dvd and broadband you 
          may interact with the media you are consuming? The death of the couch 
          potato is coming as the ability to control when to watch programs becomes 
          more flexible.</p>
