<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Make Love not Spam</h2>
        <p align="justify">Surfing through the headlines I found an article speaking 
          about Lycos and a project of theirs. Spam is an ever increasing problem 
          taking gigabytes of space on various servers around the world and wasting 
          thousands of hours for no good reason. They found that the way they 
          would like to stop or prevent spam is through a screen saver project 
          named <a href="http://www.makelovenotspam.com">Make Love Not Spam</a>, 
          taking the old hippy saying and applying it to a new context. </p>
        <p align="justify">The idea is that spammers use their websites without 
          advertising. As a result any traffic through the site makes them lose 
          money. It is hoped by increasing the amount of traffic to the website 
          over time there will be the possibility of making it to expensive for 
          spammers to continue as they have been doing. </p>
        <p align="justify">The screensaver is designed to generate a constant 
          trickle of traffic from the servers yet without overloading them. As 
          more people join in spamming will become far too expensive to continue 
          and the web will no longer be as aggravated by spammers. The more people 
          join in this effort the better it will be for the rest of us overtime. 
        </p>
