  <font face="Arial" size="2">Three was the threat of civil unrest also going to
  keeping their empire together. Their empire which is the biggest in earths
  history was huge. If you can imagine one people owning 1 1/2 continents that's
  quite impresive although really frustrating. When the got to their final
  stages of conquest of their empire they were facing a problem of keeping their
  army together so they could insure peace. In some places they garrisoned them
  in walls, cities, and forts just in case but it was hard then with advanced
  roads to keep them supplied with food, weapons, housing and soldiers. Keeping
  soldiers was a big problem too. Once they had conquered so many people they
  didnt have enough to control them so they went to the people they conquered
  and paid them. Paying everyone was a problem also because Rome was getting
  broke. Problem after problem came upon them in the final stages of Military
  weakness. So they had to cut down pay and disband soldiers to keep what men
  they needed to have. Once this spread out other people like Northern celts and
  Huns came into the empire splitting east and west. Already they couldnt supply
  their men so the men abandoned to cities and married. Some generals were on
  threat to sack Rome along with the Germanic tribes and Huns so they could gain
  positition as Emperor. By this time the Emperor was very disliked by many
  people who wanted political balance and safety from even their own men. So
  this led to some minor revolts some other things they revolted on were high
  taxes. Now most of the west except Rome was to be taken. The east had problems
  too with cut trading lines and taken farms but when Rome was taken the east
  had to fend for itself. Which is what they did and with great effect that the
  east lasted 500 more years till the invention of gunpowder. The reason was
  leadership by Constantanoble one of the&nbsp;top 5 emperors in history and a
  clear trade waterway which was protected by new advances in ballistics. One
  was Greek fire which stopped the Persian fleet. On ground they had&nbsp;a CIA
  type intelligence and a Imperial Age army with shock calvary and tough battle
  hardened infantry. Maybe it was the vastness or the government or the econimic
  standards, we may never know what the true reason for the fall of The mighty
  Roman Empire was.</font>
