        <p>When people spend a lot of time online they become very familiar with 
          the world wide web and in so doing they require and more interactivity. 
          One method of getting more interaction with people is through discussion 
          forums. From a webmaster point of view these are great because the worry 
          of providing content is far less critical than with conventional websites. 
          The site administrator now becomes more of a moderator than a creator 
          of content. He has to find a topic of discussion and encourage traffic 
          to the site but after a certain amount of time he/she may be able to 
          gain a lot. </p>
        <p>When looking at sites such as <a href="http://www.ancientworlds.net">ancientworlds</a> 
          for example the topic is the Roman civilization for which several thousand 
          lines of code are used taking advantage of PHP in order to make it interactive. 
          The interactivity gained from this site aimst towards a specialised 
          audience who work as a community to make the site more interesting. 
          Over a period of time when the audience increases so does the load on 
          the servers and the amount of work requires someone dedicating their 
          time to the maintenance of the site. A few choices for trying to make 
          the activity may include making the site paying for certain luxuries 
          such as the amount of communication you may do in one day for example.</p>
        <p>Other discussion forums such as <a href="flipside.shtml">The Flipside</a> 
          and <a href="nochick.shtml">Nochicktrix</a> may aim towards another 
          audience which is more interested in image manipulation and decay as 
          an art form within a more european group of people. With sites such 
          as Nochicktrix though it is going towards a more american timezone and 
          the content changes to news stories and more. </p>
        <p>We find that the context of the discussion group affects to a great 
          deal the form of comments on the discussion group, for example with 
          websites with news content such as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">BBC</a> 
          we find that the content is screened before being added to the discussion 
          therefore the quality of the comments may be much higher than seeing 
          forums such as those mentioned above. </p>
        <p>An occurence which I have found interesting is inter-site rivalry as 
          was shown through certain members of <a href="flipside.shtml">The Flipside</a> 
          and Akpcep. Members may begin to see a way in which they think the sites 
          may be run more efficiently and that is the moment at which there may 
          be the need for that person to start a new discussion forum of his own 
          and this may be quite interesting because of the coming of permanent 
          high speed connections. </p>
