<h1 align="center">Tanzania trip 1999</h1>
<p align="left">The Tanzania trip was a project set up by Mr and Mrs Harrison 
  a few years before I went to help Tanzanian school children get a better chance 
  at education. We went to various multintational companies and asked them whether 
  they could give us some money to fund the various projects and earned over 18,000 
  Chf. In Africa this is a lot of money and we were able to give more students 
  chances at primary and secondary education. I personally find that these forms 
  of projects are very important. We are always led to believe that through replacing 
  a dicator with another leader the people will get a chance at a better life. 
  I believe that we should concentrate on the children themselves. Through providing 
  them with the means to a better education we are giving them more choice for 
  what they will become later on in life. Enjoy these video clips</p>

      The teacher had to stand outside the window. When the weather was bad the 
      students would suffer from the cold. We actually built a new structure for
