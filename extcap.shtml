<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
<h2>External capture devices</h2>
        <p>Over the past few weeks my attention 
          has been brought towards a new generation of devices which are dedicated 
          to the capturing of video. What makes them special is that they are 
          external units which can be connected either through USB 2.0 connections 
          or else via firewire (ieee 1394) devices. What is interesting about 
          these devices is that they are not dependent upon the processing power 
          of the computer or the space within your computer. They are stand alone 
          units which take the video signal and convert it to a file type which 
          can be understood and stored by the computer. They no longer require 
          space within the frame of the computer and can be useful for the conversion 
          of video straight from one device to another.</p>
        <p>What these devices are capable 
          of depends on the model you buy, some of them are designed simply for 
          analogue capture via USB 2.0 ports whilst others are capable of capturing 
          via firewire to the hard disk and converting all this data into the 
          mpeg 2 format for direct mastering towards your dvd device. </p>

          examples of devices using these ideas. </p>
