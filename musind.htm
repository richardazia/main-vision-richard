What I meant by brunt and effect is refering to the situation with people sharing 
terabytes of music with others around the world. When you think about it the artists 
are not the ones suffering the most from this but the music industry. It is a 
multi-billion dollar industry based around the complicated pathways required to 
distribute music. 
<p>With the coming of online media and distribution the record comanies can no 
  longer justify part of their costs and must take into consideration the ease 
  with which material may be distributed in comparison when machines for the duplication 
  of music were far more expensive and when quality was lost. </p>
<p>How will a dinosaur like the media industry cope. It's been undercut at the 
  base as have huge mega corporations and the result will be a pile of rubble 
  where once stood the media industry of thirty years ago. </p>
<p>With the World Wide Web and broadband internet access the buyer is becoming 
  a media manager. He decides what style of music he likes, joins forums and groups 
  where others who appreciate the same content are and hence gets the music he 
  wants. This is all at a very reduced cost. </p>
<p>Add to this the advances in personal computing and technology and you'll see 
  that shooting a music clip with a &pound;15,000 camera several years ago can 
  be done with a meer &pound;3000 today. As to editing for a couple of hundred 
  pounds you've got a good system. </p>
<p>Hence the thought that the media industry as a whole may (not saying it will) 
  collapse as a result of file sharing and ease of distribution is an important 
  element of today's society. </p>
<p>In the same way that canals, windmills and furnaces were important during the 
  industrialisation of England and other countries so will the world wide web 
  and the internet's broadband backbone.</p>
