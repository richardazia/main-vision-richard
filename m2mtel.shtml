<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Peer to peer mobile telephony</h2>
        <p>An interesting concept brought towards the attention of people who 
          came to the 2003 telecom show is the problem of phones and phone networks 
          for celluar devices. We've all experienced times when the network coverage 
          of our phone is less than ideal whether it be in mountain towns in Switzerland 
          or the seaside in England. We have all heard that putting mobile masts 
          everywhere to provide coverage for mobile phones is not possible because 
          of risks associated with it.
        <p>The research is based around the premise that phones can be found almost 
          anywhere within the Arc Lemanic region for example. Each of these people 
          could potentialy be used as both a receiver and sender of data from 
          other people's phone conversations as a relay point. Imagine that you 
          are in a restaurant where there is no signal or the signal is very weak 
          in the section where you are seated. There are at least two or three 
          hundred people around you and they are all carrying a mobile phone with 
          them. Each of these people could serve as a link between you and a mast 
          or the person whom you are trying to contact. This means that rather 
          than be dependent on individual masts which are placed various distances 
          from each other when radio waves no longer go from your phone to the 
          transmitter you are connected through other people who are around you 
          who have a signal. 
        <p>This technology is particularly useful when in places like the Paleo 
          festival where several thousand people are saturating the single mast 
          providing coverage or in underground trains where there is a loss of 
          signal during part of your trip. It works under the assumption that 
          if one cell is out of action hundreds of others will be there to take 
          it's place providing for a far better coverage for the individual users. 
          At the same time as the user gets better service it may be found that 
          telephony providers like Sunrise, Orange, T-mobile and other networks 
          who have not got appropriate coverage would no longer need to invest 
          vast amounts of money and time in getting permission for masts but would 
          instead be reliant on those who are already using their service.
