<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves, a weekly article</h1>
        <h2>The Seti at Home project</h2>
        <p>The search for extra terrestrial life is an enormous and 
          time intensive task. Each day the sky is combed for signals coming from 
          outer space but much of it is radio noise. Each day several a huge amount 
          of data is being recorded and stored on tapes. This data must then be 
          analysed to find signals which may be extra terrestrial intelligence. 
          The data needs to be analysed and this is where Seti at home comes in. 
        </p>
        <p>Seti at home is a computer program which can run as a 
          screen saver or run in the background on your own computer. It takes 
          data from Seti at home and analyses the data. The program is looking 
          through radio interference to isolate a signal which lasts for around 
          12 seconds which is around the time for which the signal would be present 
          in the sky due to the earth's rotation. Once signals are isolated the 
          data is sent back to sent back to the server and the next work unit begins.</p>
        <h2>The technical side</h2>
        <p>All the data is collected onto tapes and in pure form 
          takes up too much space to send on the web. The data is split into more 
          managable work units through around 9 machines located at Seti at home's 
          internet site (the servers, not the documents). The data is then sent 
          via servers to be downloaded and processed by around four million computers 
          world wide and there is a computing power so great that the data is 
          being analysed faster than it is recorded although due to the parsing 
          machines being few it is not possible to send all the data out to take 
          full advantage of this. </p>
        <h2>What makes it so interesting?</h2>
        <p>What interests me most for the software is how it works. 
          It's impressive when you think that if you create the right program 
          then you deleguate to the work to as many machines as are available 
          at any one time. </p>
