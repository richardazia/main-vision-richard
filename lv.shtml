<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Link Validator</h2>
        <p>For all those of us who are administering large websites it can be 
          quite a daunting task to check that all the links on a website are working. 
          In some cases where there are over a hundred pages this task can be 
          extremely time consuming. It is for this reason that link validators 
          may be a useful tool. For certain authoring softwares these may be included 
          but they do not take all links into account. On W3 there is a section 
          for checking websites and their <a href="http://validator.w3.org/checklink" target="_blank">link 
          checker</a> may be of use to you. </p>
        <h3>Options</h3>
        <p>Amongst the options for this tool are <i>summary only, hide redirects, 
          check linked documents</i> and<i> how deep</i> and <i>save options in 
          a cookie</i>. 
        <h3>How it works</h3>
		<p>To get this tool to work simply type in the website's URL and you'll 
          watch as the links are checked for each page that is linked. With large 
          files this may take a little more time but once this is finished then 
          you may keep a summary of all the files to change. 
        <h3>Why do it?</h3>
        <p>By doing this you will make your site appear far more professional. 
          How often have you been to a website where you find that the pages which 
          you intended on visiting are no longer there? In using this little piece 
          of code you will get far fewer errors and those visiting your website 
          will leave with what they came for. </p>
