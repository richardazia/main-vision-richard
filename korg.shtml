<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>KOrganiser</h2>
      <p>Technology is a good way of getting people to organise their time better 
        and KOrganiser is one of those softwares. Bundled with the KDE software 
        as a user interface it allows you to organise and plan your time in an 
        interesting way. With a day, week and month view time managment is simplified. 
        It has an intuitive user interface which can be mastered quickly. </p>
      <p> A red bar scrolls down the day's display to indicate what you should 
        be doing at that time. It's a useful tool to keep in one of the KDE windows 
        to keep track of how you're doing timewise</p>
      <p>Another interesting feature is the time planner, which allows you to 
        see what's going on and when. It's made up of lines which represent the 
        times at which something is planned, much like the planner you may have 
        on a wall. It's a shame that there is no description of the task in this 
        view. </p>
      <p>Finally when using several computers it can be a challenge to keep a 
        record of everything you have to do when away from the home terminal. 
        It is possible to export this data as a html page for websites. </p>
      <p>Overall this could be an interesting tool for those who are tired of 
        the windows environment.</p>
