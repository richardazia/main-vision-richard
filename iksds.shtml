<h1>Le Cr&eacute;puscule des dieux de la <b>Steppe</b></h1>
<p>The book explores the life of an Albanian student living in Russia during the 
  time at which Boris Pasternak received his nobel prize for the book Doctor Zhivago. 
  This book explores the relations between Russia and Albania at the time of writing. 
</p>
<p>I learned a new word when reading the book which is &quot;Bessa&quot;. It is 
  described through the legend of a family during a conflict several hundred years 
  ago during a time of war where a mother sees all her sons go to war and her 
  daughter leave for a country beyond the mountains. One of these brothers gives 
  his &quot;Bessa&quot; to bring back the daughter before going to fight. </p>
<p>All the sons die in the conflict and they are all buried in the same cemetery 
  where the mother comes to speak to them and let them know how much she misses 
  them. For the fourth son though she spits on his grave and curses him for having 
  not kept his promise/bessa. </p>
<p>The son remembering the promise he had made before going to war resurects from 
  the dead, gets a horse and travels for several days and nights to get to his 
  sister. When she sees him she asks him why he is so pale and why he's covered 
  in mud but he doesn't answer. Once they get back to the cemetery he gets off 
  the horse, turns around and tells his sister to continue towards home, he has 
  something to do at the gates of the cemetery. She arrives home whilst he having 
  accomplished his &quot;Bessa&quot; can now rest in peace.</p>
