<h3>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h3>
        <h1>Tim Berners Lee</h1>
        <p>For most the World Wide Web has become an important part of our lives, 
          for some more so than others. In <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3357073.stm" target="_blank">Tim 
          Berners Lee (TBL) being knighted</a> his importance has been recognised. 
          He originaly created the hyper text markup language (HTML) to display 
          information on the computers. He also created the Hypertext transfer 
          protocol (HTTP) which made it possible to transfer these files from 
          one computer to another. His book <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006251587X/perspectives">Weaving the Web</A> exlpains 
          how he went about this. </p>
        <p>Reading about his knighthood I have thought about the innovation of 
          the World Wide Web but also the huge potential it has for revolutionising 
          our society. We used to live in a society where we called people, sent 
          letters and transfered documents from one place to another physically. 
          By creating the World Wide Web TBL created a platform for people to 
          communicate via computers speeding up people's work. Rather than using 
          internal mail services to transfer documents, have them edited then 
          send them back it is now possible for a document to be edited, e-mailed 
          and re-edited in a short amount of time. With Instant messaging software 
          it has become available to converse with people around the world irrespective 
          of time zones and more. </p>
        <p>What is most interesting with the World Wide Web is it's ability to 
          create new jobs. A few years ago the web was no more than a few lines 
          of text displayed on a screen. Today the World Wide Web is the future 
          of television, voting and more. Through portals such as yahoo, google 
          and many more we are living in a society where distances have become 
          far smaller. We live in a society where we are aiming for instant gratification, 
          where if there is a song we like then either we will go to some websites 
          to watch the clip online or we will download the clip and listen to 
          it from home. Other people are working on the SETI@home project allowing 
          for their computer to work for the international community. </p>
        <p>The World Wide Web is the future of television and entertainment. With 
          projects such as Internet2 and The Grid we are approaching a society 
          where machines are connected together via higher and higher bandwidth 
          connections. Television will no longer require us to live our life according 
          to the programmer's schedule and we will no longer wait a few months 
          for films to be released in our country as we will be able to download 
          them within a few seconds from the web. </p>
        <p>Through creating the World Wide Web Tim Berners Lee created a new environment 
          within which people can work. It is sometimes viewed as one of the most 
          important revolutions the World has seen. </p>
