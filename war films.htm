</td>
      <td width="584" height="102">Vietnam War film based on a book by Lt. Col.
        Harold Moore starring Mel Gibson. The film is about a group of soldiers
        whom are dropped in a location from which they draw heavy fire. They are
        aiming to survive as long as possible before re-enforcements may come to
        relieve them. Among the people there is a journalist and this
        character's evolution throughout the film is a powerful element of the
        film.&nbsp;
        <p>It's a good film which I would recommend to anyone whom likes the
        Genre&nbsp;</td>

</td>
      <td width="584" height="125">Black Hawk Down is a beautifully edited film.
        Winner of an Oscar for best film directing we see beautiful shots of
        &quot;Hawks&quot; taking the five minute flight into Mogadishu in
        Somalia. What was meant to be a routine mission turns into a disaster as
        the operation took place during the day. The streets erupt with fighting
        and the American Soldiers are pinned down for what will become more than
        20hrs.&nbsp;
        <p>The film was so powerful I decided to read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0871137380/perspectives">book</a>
        and the book written by Mark Bowden is a really good read</td>

      <td width="584" height="62">Empire of the Sun, an early Steven Spielberg

        from his parents after the Japanese attacked the city in which
        he was living. The way in which he is transported into a prisoner camp.
        The cinematography and story telling of this film are amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>

        stands out from the rest.</td>

</td>
      <td width="584" height="0">During the 2nd World War a battle was taking
        place between the Germans and Russians for the city of Stalingrad. The
        capture of this city is of great propaganda value. Vasiliev is a small
        boy from the Caucasus who has learnt the art of sharp shooting. He
        becomes a propaganda tool for the Soviets. One of the top German
        marksmen is called in to kill Vasiliev. This film is the tale of these
        two individuals in a sea of people fighting for many years in a row.&nbsp;
        <p>The cinematography and editing within this film are among the most powerful
        I have seen in recent films and I would recommend that
