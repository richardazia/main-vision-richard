<h3>Building A Road</h3>
<img height="246" alt="Frieze2.jpg (42791 bytes)" src="images/FRIEZE2.JPG" width="305">
                      <p><big>W</big>hen the Romans built roads they used great 
                        accuracy. When they made roads they made sure that it 
                        was pointing in the right direction so that it was as 
                        straight as possible. They did that by using two sticks 
                        which had weights hanging from each side. The person making 
                        sure that it was straight they aligned the weights so 
                        that they could not see the others as it was covered by 
                        the others. This meant that it was straight. after that 
                        to make a road they built a road they dug a hole that 
                        was 1 meter deep. They then put large stones and then 
                        smaller stones. They then put a layer of pebbles and then 
                        sand to make it smooth. When they had finished they put 
                        stone slabs that were flat and the right size. When they 
                        got to a river they took some boats and attached them 
                        together. When this was finished they built the next bridge 
                        in that area. To build the bridge they pushed wooden logs 
                        to keep the water out while they built it. they blocked 
                        the holes with silt that stuck. When they had done that 
                        they pumped the water out. When they had done that they 
                        started to put a layer of bitumen and then stones and 
                        they continued until it was the right height. When they 
                        have done that they put the road on the foundations. When 
                        they make the road they then make the middle higher so 
                        that when there is rain water it gets drained to the side.</p>

            <img src="https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/IMG_0944-300x225.jpg">
                      <p align="left"><big>A</big>n aqueduct is a channel built 
                        by man to bring water from one place to the other. They 
                        used it to bring water from a stream to a bath house or 
                        other buildings. They had to make sure that everything 
                        was straight. To do this they used levelling equipment 
                        to make it level so that it flows to the destination. 
                        This was hard because they needed to make special equipment 
                        to be able to do that. The equipment they used was chorobats. 
                        To use these instruments you made sure that the water 
                        in the middle was straight and level. They measure the 
                        distance from the ground level to the imaginary level 
                        that the aqueduct was supposed to be at. They did this 
                        at every 1 meter 20 centimetres. They made sure that it 
                        was to high for people to poison or steal some of the 
                        water. To support the weight of the pillars they had to 
                        make some big foundations so that it would not sink. They 
                        used cement and stones to do it with. When they got to 
                        a hill they drilled through it. they build a shaft every 
                        20 meters and when they did that they measured the height 
                        to make sure that it was at the right level. While they 
                        dug through the hills they placed the stones while they 
                        were making it.</p>
                        <p>When it arrived to the city the 
            aqueduct went into a water tank. Every water tank was covered by a 
            cement vault. They then made some wood supports which were curved. 
            They then placed bricks in an arc. When they did that they put 
            cement to make it solid. When this was done and it held the roof 
            they then removed the wood supports. They then put pipes so that the 
            water could be taken to where they wanted it. They then covered the 
            roof of the container with tiles and sloping roof so that it looked 
            nicer.</p>

            <h3>The builder's tools</a></h3>
            <img height="310" alt="RomeBridge.jpg (43458 bytes)" src="images/RomeBridge.jpg" width="293" />
                      <p><big>T</big>he Romans used the same type of tools as 
                        the workers use now. When they wanted to pull heavy weights 
                        up they used something similar to a crane but it was in 
                        wood and powered by a man walking in a wheel to make the 
                        objects go up. When they built things they used the same 
                        tools but they also had a levelling table and things like 
                        that to make sure the aqueduct or the roads. The tools 
                        still have not been changed.</p>
