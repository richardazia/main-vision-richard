<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Mercora</h2>
      <p>As Broadband access becomes available to more people and as the problems 
        of file sharing become more dangerous from a legal standpoint for students 
        there is an interesting alternative. The alternative is a small program 
        called Mercora, a client which you download to windows 2000 and windows 
        xp. </p>
      <p>It works as a peer to peer (P2P) radio station where several radio stations 
        are listed. This program searches your computer for music files and indexes 
        them. Once this is done you begin webcasting your music from your computer 
        to whoever wants to listen to what you're playing. </p>
      <p>The reason for which this particular webcasting method is legal is because 
        you have no control over what order the music will play and you are unauthorised 
        to tell people when certain songs will be playing. In so doing you will 
        not come head to head with the RIAA, at least for the moment. </p>
