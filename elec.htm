        DCRVX2000 MiniDV Digital Camcorder with 2.5" LCD, Memory Stick & BuiltIn 
        Digital Still Mode</A> </p>
      <p>The VX 2000 is a good all round camera, it is easy to use and has many 
        features which would encourage someone to use it. From the outside we 
        see that the camera has a focusing ring and a zoom ring, both accesible 
        at the same time unlike with other camera models. The focus ring is fairly 
        easy to use although it takes a little bit of time to become fully proficient. 
        The zoom can be controled by servo or manually at different speeds, when 
        the zoom is controlled manually though the motor is taking feedback from 
        your fingers for speed rather than being applied directly to the lens.
