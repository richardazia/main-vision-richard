    <div><p>Nyon is a town in Switzerland. It was founded by Roman troops over 2000 years
ago, in 50-44 bC, after the wars in Gaul. It was named &quot;colonia Iulia
equestris&quot;, after Julius Caesar. It's older than its sister cities (Copia
Felix Munatia Lugdunensis) Lyon and (colonia Raurica) which were founded in
44/43 bC by Munatius Plancus. These three cities were some of the last to be
founded during the wars in Gaul for the soldiers or cavalry, giving them the
name Equestris.</p>
