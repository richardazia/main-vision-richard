<p>Although I go to the International school of Geneva I do not experience an international environment, we are all wealthy enough to go to the school which is fairly expensive, we are used to our
sheltered lives therefore traveling is something which truly enables us to experience different cultures from Switzerland through Europe, America, Egypt, Jordan, Turkey right down to Martinique or my
most recent journey to <a href="handin.htm">Tanzania</a>, which endured German and Later English rule before finally becoming independent.</p>
