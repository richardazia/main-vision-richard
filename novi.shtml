<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Taking video with a mobile phone</h2>
        <p>The nokia 6230 is a great piece of technology. It's a 
          multimedia centre on something no larger than other nokia phones. It 
          comes with picture capability, mp3 playing and far more. One of the 
          features I enjoyed playing with last night was the video recording. 
          It's a very low quality of image. The reason for which it is becoming 
          so popular is that people love to have memories without the drag of 
          carrying around huge obnoxious cameras to private parties etc. </p>
        <p>I was taking video and as the night went on we watched 
          the various videos, laughed and continued shooting. It's a way of documenting 
          student life for example in a new experimental method. </p>
