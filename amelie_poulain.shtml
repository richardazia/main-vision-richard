    <h1>Amelie Poulain</h1>
<h2>Different films require different critical
approaches. Choose a film or tv program and discuss the most rewarding critical
theories and methods for a thorough understanding of it's importance.</h2>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">In
the film Sense Sergei Eisenstein speaks of how each shot within a sequence is
like a line within a poem. In this particular situation the poet would be Jaques
Prevert, writer of the script for "Les Enfants du Paradis" and "Quai Des
Brumes". These films were part of the French Poetic movement which was
important from the mid 1930's onwards when the larger studios such as Pathe
and Gaumont lost their place in the market giving a greater freedom to the
smaller independent producers. Producers and directors were free to make their
films and had access to the big studios and their facilities. As part of this
they were also able to use the cinema circuits for the projection of their
pieces so that a new wider market was easier to access . Marcel Carne who worked
with Jaques Prevert on films such as Les Enfants du Paradis and Quai des Brumes
inspired Jean Pierre Jeunet for his own film. Whereas their was a movement of
socio-realism this movement was based upon work within studios which attempted
to recreate Paris. The characters within these pieces were normally male and
facing problems. A lot of poetic symbolism was used, for example with setting,
gesture. Verbal and non verbal actions as well as movements and lighting. This
ties in with Le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie because he is using elements within
that style to demonstrate Amelie within a modern Paris. The setting being
Montmartre and Audrey Tautou working within a studio for certain scenes whilst
going out to the "Des Deux Moulins" for the scenes within the café.
Amelie's character itself goes away from the French poetic movement in that
she is female and works to bring happiness to herself through good actions to
others.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">To some extent the film would also be part of the art cinema. This is particularly
visible through its being far more character based. We are exposed to every
character and certain scenes are designed away from the American studio's way
of creating characters. No character within the film is superficial. The way the
film is constructed and sequences are done becomes more artistic but I will
discuss this further when looking at the technology which was used for the post
production of this film. The new wave cinema which is aimed and created by
younger people may also become important in analyising this film because of the
subject matter which we see exposed through the use of characters and where they
are age wise within the film.</span></p>
<p>Through the 3rd person omniscient narration we are taken into
a world we have never experienced, structured as Milan Kundera novels and Jaques
Prevert poems. Jaques Prevert wrote poetry, which spoke of simple things making
transforming them into something else; he played with absurdity and with
existentialism. Throughout the film we come to the problems of existence. As a
person we must be happy with what we are doing and ourselves, make others
appreciate what we do and have a lot of self respect and self confidence before
even moving into a relationship.</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">This
is very different from American films and their philosophy because whereas in
America it is viewed that you must win someone else other rather than yourself.
Amelie Poulain does actions which make her happy with whom she is and through
doing things for others, not being egocentric she becomes a much stronger
character within the plot. There is a message of self-acceptance rather than
expecting others to accept you. Manon Des Sources and so many other films within
Europe are as much about community as anything else, community is important
within Roberto Begnini's "La Vita e Bella", "Chocolate" develops a
sense of community and its importance to a greater degree. If we were to take
Bridget Jones's character with that of Amelie Poulain most people would prefer
Amelie because of her kind-hearted nature. Through her we find out about the
importance of our own place within society before that of within a single other
person's life.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Elements
within the film could illustrate poems such as "Le Cancre" where a student
goes up to the board but rather than do the work he is meant to erases all that
is bad and replaces that with</span></p>
<quote class="quote-center">
    <span lang="FR">sur le tableau noir du malheur<br>
    il dessine le visage du bonheur</span>
</quote>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">Amelie is
"Le Cancre" and becomes le Cancre whilst listening to news of Princess
Diana's death on France 2 whilst in the bathroom. At the same moment the ball,
which serves as a top for a bottle falls to the ground and rolls towards a tile
dislodging it and uncovering a secret box affecting the rest of the film. Within
the film and the poem these occurrences help to demonstrate how personal
happiness is attained through forgetting about things that make us unhappy, of
wiping the slate clean in effect and starting anew. Her good actions are quite
timid at the beginning and through times they become more important. Through the
generosity of her actions she gains self-confidence and begins to think more
about herself. This moves away from what we see in American films where the
characters think only of themselves. Amelie's character is far more complex
because of the way she evolves throughout the film. It is through her actions to
bring pleasure to others that she thinks more about herlself for the conclusion
of the film.</span></p>
<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Amelie's
behaviour could be taken to be generous and charitable through actions she
carries out. When she finds the box and returns it to his owner her charitable
action moves her into wanting to do more charitable actions, thinking more about
others than herself opening a way for critics to comment about its socialist
nature at moments, working for the greater good of a community. At other moments
such as in the street when she helps the blind man by accompanying him along and
recounts what is around him this act of charity could be seized upon as an act
of kindness and charity, something which Christianity would look kindly onto.</span></p>
<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Whilst
we have scene the strength of Amelie Poulain we may notice how it seems fascist
because of the lack of any other ethnicity within the film, never do we see
anyone other than white people in the film's Paris. There is no mention of
homo-sexuality therefore some critics may feel that it is a sign of fascist
tendencies. From my personal point of view I believe that adding certain groups
of people would not contribute to the film, after all it is the story of Amelie,
not of the city. If Amelie does not experience these films then it is irrelevant
to our understanding of the film.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">In terms of
audience and their look on le Fabuleux Destin D'Amelie Poulain because it is
based in France it shows a different culture, different locations and more. The
location is one which so many Europeans know because they have travelled there.
The world and culture within the film are typically French, rather for example
than seeing everyone sitting at a pub drinking we have them in a café. Rather
than people going to the super bowl we have them going to cathedrals etc. It
allows the French to be voyeuristic about a world that they know and have
experienced. The language itself is quite important for the audience, being
given the precise time of day, the likes and dislikes of the characters etc. all
help to give it cultural identity, the humor within the language is French.</span></p>

<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The
inter-textuality is quite important with this film, mentioning Diana's death
through France 2, showing Etoile Etoile, which is a program by Fred Mitterand,
all help to make the audience feel it is something they know and live with each
day. Jamel whom was on television plays a minor role without the director
knowing how important he would become through other television programs.</span></p>
<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Through
having a smaller industry the structure is far better because Jean Pierre Jeunet
did not need to speak to studio executives all the time to defend every small
idea so it was far more creative from his point of view. Added to this is the
fact that the technology allows for making the director's role and that of the
crew more varied. Technology was important whilst editing Le Fabuleux Destin
D'Amelie Poulain because it required no negative cutting; instead everything
was digitized and edited on a non-linear system. Through editing through this
method he was able to play around far more with the structure of the film
because of the amount of time saved during postproduction. Due to where he was
editing he was able to participate far more in directing the special effects,
for example with compositing certain shots like the speaking paintings, split
screen photographs and the replacement of boring skies with more interesting
skies. Through the advances in postproduction technology and its spreading
the director's role in France is not simply confined to directing the actors
but to every single stage of production. The director in effect understands the
whole process and through understanding the whole process can give far better
directions to the crew whom is working for him.</p>

<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The
way in which the audience and the industry have embraced Le Fabuleux Destin
D'Amelie is quite important. With it being the most successful foreign film in
America Canada and England it demonstrates its international values for the
audience. The audience for this film is an international one. Apart from the
audience appreciating the industry recognizes the film, winning the Goya for
best foreign film, best foreign film for the Broadcast Film Critics association,
prix du public at the Chicago film Festival, and many other awards show how
important and influential this film has been. The music is iconic of the film as
well, whenever the music is heard people instantly think of the film, giving the
music's creator fame.</span></p>

<p;text-indent:36.0pt"><span lang="EN-GB">In
conlusion through studying the origins of the unique style of the film we begin
to understand a lot more about the film, for example through knowing that he was
inspired by Jaques Prevert makes a large difference as it helps to do more
research on Jean Pierre Jeunet and the film genres he was inspired by. At the
same time through studying the audience we have another incite to the film as a
whole both from their reaction to it as well as from the type of film you would
expect. It separates itself greatly from the American film industry for example.
Finally understanding the language is a great help to understand what culture
inspired Jean Pierre Jeunet to create this type of character.</span></p>
