<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Mapping London.</h2>
	        <p>London's tube map is interesting because it has little 
          relation with the world that can bve found on the surface apart from 
          the names of stations. It is a symbol of London recognised by anyone 
          who has taken the London underground. It's an interesting method by 
          which to represent the lives of those living in London. It creates relations 
          between people living in the same region. It also gives a slice of life 
          at each location, helping to understand advantages and non advantages 
          of those locations. </p>
        <p>When you look at the <a href="http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/map.php">full 
          map</a> you see all the stations and lines. Each square represents a 
          few stations. Click and you see which stations are around that tube 
          stop. My uni is by <a href="http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/station.php?id=186">this</a> 
          station. At the moment there are only three or four other blogs but 
          as this site may become more popular more and more people will use it. 
          For example the <a href="http://www.thesmokemag.co.uk/">student magazine</a> 
          which is shapped like a blog should be added to at least three tube 
          stations to reflect the lives of those people. </p>

            <script src="http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/browser.php?ids=186" type="text/javascript"></script>
          </p>
          <p>At the moment the station which appears to have the most blogs is 
            <a href="http://londonbloggers.iamcal.com/station.php?id=180">London 
            Bridge</a>, probably one of the best known symbols of London.</p>
          <p>At the moment only around five million brits have high speed internet 
            access to the home but the number is rising by around six thousand 
            a day if my memory is correct. That means that if one or more out 
            of every thousand people create a blog in London we could soon see 
            that the 1600 blogs currently up for London will mushroom in size 
            to more than 10,000, at which point a proper search engine may be 
            needed . </p>
          <p>If China and India become more comfortable with information technology 
            how will their tube maps contribute to the overall feel of the web 
            as we see it in the near future?</p>
