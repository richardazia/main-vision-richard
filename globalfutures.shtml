<h3 align="center">The future of the media and the process of Globalisation. </h3>
<hr>
<p>For several years I have lived in a multi channel environment. At the beginning 
  these channels were TSR, TSI, TF1, Antenne 2 (now France 2) and DRS. These channels 
  have been available to television viewers for years in Western Switzerland. 
  As a result I have grown up with a multilingual, multinational media. Studying 
  in an international school and working in international organisations have broadened 
  my worldview.Making friends for short periods before they move onto another 
  country. This has affected the way I consume the media, following BBC world, 
  following world news and current affairs to understand today's world. Studying 
  literature, geography, languages and history have all helped</p>
<p>Over the past weeks I have spent countless hours thinking about globalisation 
  and the future of the media, not knowing which elements fit to which essay. 
  Al last I have finished both pieces of work and this is a synthesis of both 
  essays. </p>
<p>Chapter four of the BBC charter considers that England is a mature country 
  for it's multi-ethnic population. The fact foreign nationals live in England 
  has become mainstream. I queued up and I saw Eastern Europeans, British, Middle 
  Eastern and African people. These individuals are studying a variety of courses 
  at the same university. They are usually leading the world in social theory 
  and other fields and reflect how things are going to change. </p>
<p>Culture is pervasive, &quot;ordinary&quot; as Raymond Williams thought, part 
  of everyday life. In a place like Great Britain this is interesting because 
  it has one of the world's most advanced media landscapes. Digital video broadcasting 
  (DVB) by Freeview on terrestrial does not offer great choice in ethnic programming, 
  prefering to concentrate on the mass audience. In contrast British Sky Broadcasting, 
  a satellite broadcasting company offers a great variety of content. With the 
  digital revolution it has space for hundreds of channels ranging from Discovery 
  packages to news, music and other theme channels. Already looking in the special 
  interests section we get a view into the future of the British satellite environment.There 
  are channels from Bangladesh, India, China and Japan. So far these are commercial 
  channels rather than national channels. The distinction is made because over 
  the coming years as the digital divide is bridged chances are that we will gain 
  a greater variety of choice which I will come back to.</p>
<p>During the 2003 WSIS conference in Geneva time was taken in defining what changes 
  would needed to bridge the digital divide. </p>

<p>For some this task appears to be a mammoth undertaking, especially since for 
  an information society to work literacy is one of the most important pre-requisits. 
  For any progress to be made to create a media literate society money must be 
  invested to provide both an infrastructure for learning but also for other basic 
  services like labour and health. Last year a report was released entitled &quot;Towards 
  a fair globalisation, check title&quot;, which details the need for people to 
  work out of poverty through decent work. Another element of this argument or 
  concern was the idea of indecent work for children, making sure that each child 
  would have the opportunity to study at primary and secondary levels. This education 
  is essential for anyone working and living in an information society because 
  once a person is given the tools to learn then they may learn independently 
  of other people. From that point on there are no limits to what individuals 
  can acheive.</p>
<p>In any advanced society television and radio are two essential elements. These 
  two media are one of the best ways by which to create national integrity, through 
  national news bulletins, television series and educational programing. As more 
  and more people gain access to these technologies so does the interest of commercial 
  arms to provide more entertaining programs as a means for advertising more products. 
  As time progresses and the people's traditions adapt towards a different way 
  of life centered around the media some people fear that the heritage of the 
  children may be losed. I feel differently about this. Over a period of several 
  months I followed a group of young Albanians in Geneva and saw that through 
  the Albanian popular university Rinia contact was formed. This is a small community 
  level project but with great importance to the children of immigrants. As the 
  children are born in a nation other than that of their parent's they have little 
  access to their cultural heritage. Such projects make sure that the knowledge 
  remains within the heart of these young adults. </p>
<p>Some people beleive that globalisation is nothing more than the parasitic encroachment 
  of one culture over another but I see things differently. I often think of the 
  word internationalisation rather than globalisation. Globalisation can mean 
  a number of things although to the altermondialiste (other world) are against 
  this term, prefering to think of an alternative process. I think this process 
  would be internationalisation. The word international, from the context I was 
  brought up in, is used to refer to a mentality where age, colour race and ethnic 
  background are a source of interest rather than hate. The interest I am refering 
  to is curiosity, for example imagine that one of your friends is from Mexico, 
  an other is from Sweden and a third is from Montenegro. Not only will you know 
  where these countries are in the world but you will also know what they are 
  known for, the languages that are spoken and the cultural products of that country. 
  By cultural products I mean literature, the cinema, the Arts and food. Being 
  a member of the international community means that you know people from every 
  continent and a great number of countries. Being international is about how 
  we live our lives, and is part of our philosophy of life.</p>
<p>Future structure of the media</p>
<p>In the United States of America cultural production is an industry. Films are 
  worked on by teams of highly specialised people as well as television series. 
  As a result when a script is written it is a collaboration between a team of 
  people. When teams work together they must meet compromises and they decide 
  which elements will work and which will not. One of the consequences of such 
  labour intensive creative processes is mass appeal, something which other nation's 
  media industries do not concentrate on to the same degree. </p>
<p>Another important element is funding. When you're in a country the size of 
  Switzerland or Estonia it's far more expensive to create programs for such a 
  small audience. The European Union has recently had a number of programs to 
  encourage co productions and so have various broadcasters. Recently the European 
  Broadcasting Union based in Geneva has worked in helping European broadcasters 
  create series where each country creates one episode in the series. This provides 
  for a variety of ideas and because the cost is shared more productions can be 
  completed. </p>
<p>Over the coming years we can expect that as the WSIS projects get under way 
  to bring other nations up to a more media rich environment that countries like 
  Mali, Tanzania and Bhutan will start broadcasting and providing their content. 
  More to the point the digital means are already there so that each broadcaster 
  can reach a global audience through satellite broadcasting. We have seen the 
  way that search engines have moved from the web onto the desktop and in the 
  near future as the broadcasters provide more channels we can expect that the 
  technology and the requirements of the audience will mean that you could find 
  a google like search engine on your electronic programme guide. </p>
<p>The CERN who are currently building their large hadron collider are developing 
  the datagrid, a system of computers which will allow for the transfer of gigabits 
  of data per second from terabytes of storage space. With a more advanced infrastructure 
  than that offered by Abilene or Internet 2 we will find that data transfer speeds 
  will increase so much that the national archive of films for each broadcaster 
  will be digitized and stored on servers, accessible for a small fee by anyone 
  who wishes to take advantage of this offer. Not only will there no longer be 
  the need to go down and rent dvd from the store as you can do it online but 
  if there are rare films you would not have access to the new media landscape 
  would make them available for you. This is particularly interesting for film 
  students and film enthusiasts alike. </p>
<p>In the media landscape of the future interactivity will be one of the strongest 
  features around. As WIFI and laptops become more ubiquitous so people will move 
  their web habits from the computer or bedroom out into the living room. As they 
  watch television shows or follow the news they will be discussing the topics 
  they see on tv and compare views and opinions with other viewers of the same 
  programs. Rather than sending an sms when voting takes place they will be able 
  to the website, generating hits and revenue for advertisers, and chose the person. 
  This will not be country dependent therefore like a recent miss world type event 
  people will vote from around the world in real time. </p>
<p>When students are learning aboutn cultures, about geography or the sea they 
  will be able to communicate to experts from the comfort of their classroom or 
  even pilot minisubmersibles through a coral reef (with built in safety features 
  of course to avoid damaging the coral). As a result the world will no longer 
  be something seen on television, it will be something experienced. In other 
  words television will become more active, no longer the 20th century couch potatoe 
  anymore. </p>
<p>Although the media are important today they will be far more important in the 
  near future and programs will no longer be restricted to their countries of 
  origin. The World Wide Web and television programs will be in as many languages 
  and from as many countries as exist, creating an international television environment 
  requiring advanced categorisation of channels, program content and such. In 
  effect English will no longer be the dominant language on the web. Although 
  it seems chaotic now in future chances are that new better systems of organisation 
  will already have been found.</p>
