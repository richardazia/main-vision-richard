        <h2>High speed data transfer</h2>
        <p>Over the past few days CERN have been discussing high speed data transfer via 
          fibre optic links. This demonstration is particularly interesting because 
          of the speed at which these transfers are being made. </p>
<p>The technology behind these trials is not yet available to the public and there 
  are only a limited amount of servers able to send files at such high speeds. 
  They have succesfully sent files at speeds of up to 5.6 gigabits per second. 
  With the ADSL Modem you are receiving data at around 128Kb/s. In Effect the 
  CERN used the Translantic grid network to send data at the rate of one dvd per 
  second. </p>
        <p>The challenge itself is quite impressive considering the technology behind 
          it. Firstly you need two powerful machines, one set up to receive the 
          data and the other to transmit. The point about transferring such huge 
          amounts of data is that you need to store all this information in the 
          Random access memory before you are able to send it down the tube. Quite 
          large amounts of ram are required to store this data before sending 
          therefore you'd need at least 8Gbytes of ram before you're able to send 
          the data down the line to be received. To give you an idea of the amount 
          of data imagine that your connection is a water pistol and the CERN's 
          usage is a firehose. With this comparison you get an idea of the huge 
          quantity of data travelling down the line at just one moment.</p>
        <p>Limitations with such high amounts of data are actually found within 
          the machines themselves. The amount of processing power and the amount 
          of RAM required is more than can be found in conventional equipment 
          and at the moment one of the larger problems is an element of too much 
          capacity in terms of badnwidth compared to what can be used either over 
          the fibre or by the various ISP's who would need to upgrade their own 
          system. </p>
