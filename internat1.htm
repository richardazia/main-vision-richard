<p><big>About the International evening:</big></p>
<p>The International evening is an event in which people demonstrate different
aspects of their cultures and consists of acting and tasting food from different
countries, I was there to shoot the event and served as the sound engineer when
I dubbed the tracks onto minidisk so that when I would get to editing (which I
have not done yet) I will have the best sound quality possible.</p>
<p><big>The aim of shooting this event:</big></p>
<p>When I was shooting this event I was concentrating on experimenting with
different angles as well as getting behind the scenes footage.</p>
<p><big>General comments:</big></p>
<p>There were people doing a play, others dancing, some singing and poetry
reading with a fashion show to conclude.</p>
<p><big>Behind the scenes:</big></p>
<p>The behind the scenes footage was not as complete as I wanted, mostly I
managed to get people rehearsing their acts, the final song and instructions on
how to walk for the concluding fashion show, here it was fairly interesting
because I managed to get different angles for a single act, seeing the people
rehearse and hearing them giving feedback to each other. I could have shot more
of the preparations with the lights and the technical side but I was doing the
sound therefore I could not.</p>
<p><big>About the first two dances:</big></p>
<p>During the actual show I used two cameras, one static getting a wide shot of
the action on stage while the other camera was used to get a variety of shots.
The first act was a hip hop dance and for this I shot it from the side so that
you see both performers sometimes concentrating on one, then the other and
overall I managed to get the action for this. After this was a Mexican dance and
I moved so that I was to the right side of the stage and audience so that you
see the performers from the side and since they were pointing in this direction
while the audience saw them from the side most of the time I got one of them
head on while the other from the back and I like the effect I got.</p>
<p><big>Pianist:</big></p>
<p>Filming someone playing the piano is interesting because of all the different
angles which you could use although I was to the pianist's left and got a medium
shot showing the piano and the person and moved to show the hands dancing on the
keyboard and a close up of the player's face to show the player's concentration.</p>
<p><big>Actors</big></p>
<p>There were two theatrical people and each one did a different sketch, one
about a shipwreck, the other was from a french play although I do not remember
the name. I filmed the first actress from a high angle looking down on her which
was a waste of time when she was directly below... although this may not be
true, depending on the effect you are trying to get. She was meant to be going
mad therefore the audience may get paternal, or maternal as the case may be
through seeing it from that angle. It became useful overall because had I been
at the front of the stage it may have been harder to see all that was happening.</p>
<p><big>Vocal:</big></p>
<p>One of the people whom I know in the show is a skilled singer and is
recognised by many people and during the show she went to the front of the stage
and sang from there and I was near the front but below the audience's eye line
so that the camera was looking up at her so that she appears dominant. I found
that this part was interesting to shoot because it was a close-up and we could
see her fairly well in the footage. The problem with this shot was mostly that I
had forgotten to check with which hand she holds the mike, I hadn't thought
about it when I had filmed the practice but because she is right handed and I
was to her left the microphone covered her face for a large part of the singing
which was a shame.</p>
<p><big>The Fashion show:</big></p>
<p>I shot this from different angles, from the front so that I was at the end of
the runway which could be an interesting shot although I found that it was
fairly useless for the edit since there is no second shot which is wide to show
the people turning to show the clothes. The stage was shaped like a T so if you
can visualise that I was on the inside part of the T so that the top bar is in
front of me and then to my right as I pan and the runway is to my left, close to
the center I was able to show the people coming towards the camera, turning into
the main axis and from here they walked away from the camera towards the
audience, if I had been higher and with a smaller lens angle (I was using the
wide angle lens attachment on the PC7) so that there would be less flare in the
camera, the second change would be to get higher thereby not getting the lights
directly into the lens and onto the CCD to reduce glare.</p>
<p><big>All the performers singing together:</big></p>
<p>At the end of the event everyone came onto the platform to sing and another
person placed himself at the piano and played the song's tune. I got an over the
shoulder shot looking from the person playing the piano to the singers and moved
to get some close ups of the people singing.</p>
<p><big>My thoughts on the shoot:</big></p>
<p>This was an interesting shoot because I had spent the previous three days
working on sound and staying after school each night so that I would know the
performances by the people and could anticipate which shots and to a large
extent it worked and I am happy of that, oh apart from a small detail which was
that since there was so little light the depth of field was reduced thereby
making it harder to keep the performers in focus. I would therefore advise any
person shooting a play to advise the light engineer that there should be more
lights so that the performers are appropriately lit.</p>
