</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">MASH, a
film based on a novel is a very interesting film because of the way it goes
against Hollywood’s cinema. It was created on as low a budget as possible to
keep the financier’s eyes away from the set where it was being shot. It was
during the editing time that Paramount studios found out about this film but it
made the release.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Trapper
John is the self-portrait of Richard Hooker whom wrote MASH and based the novel
on him and the experiences that he had during his time as a surgeon in Korea. It
was written in the 1960’s and released in 1968 when an anti-authoritarian
feeling was very present in America with the feeling that there was no point in
fighting wars in other parts of the world. This national mood is very helpful in
understanding the novel. When we move onto the film we see that Twentieth
Century Fox took on Ring Lardner Jr. whom was blacklisted. After some time
searching for a director Robert Altman was chosen, director of many previous
films. Although based in Korea it was to be taken as a direct reflection of
events in Vietnam at that period of time, criticizing both of the military body
as a whole and the deployment to a war thousands of kilometers away from home to
fight what was felt to be another man’s war.</span></p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">An
unknown cast of actors were chosen in order for the director to shine rather
than the actors. It was made at the same time as Patton and another major war
film at the time and Altman’s aim was to keep the film below budget so that
his unconventional style would make it hopefully to the editing room. He cut
costs on sets, location and actors. The low budget of the film was intended to
keep attention away from MASH so that the unconventional directing and subject
matter would remain.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Although
he seemed not to be in control and he was breeding diss-satisfaction behind the
sets within the film there is such energy that we would feel that the cast know
themselves as well of screen as they do on screen. If at moments the cast were
becoming less comfortable with all that was happening at least during the
shooting no real diss-satisfaction succeeded in permeating to destroy the chances
of the film being made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Visually
for scenes such as in Tokyo with the camera being followed by the main
characters we get a point of view shot of people whom would otherwise have been
seen from a third person impersonal view. This helps to bring the viewer into
having an experience that would help bring the willing suspense of disbelief to
another level. This would be helped through technology like cameras, faster film
stocks etc. allowing for an unchained camera and the use of in shot lights (practicals)
would make a shot otherwise impossible to do quite interesting and in some ways
key to the plot in particular from the surgeon whom disrespects army standard
procedures.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Sound</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Another
element of this can be seen through the architecture of the sound within the
film such as the mess tent at the beginning of the film. We hear the two main
characters speaking whilst at the same time there is overlapping sound with a
discussion that the colonel is having with Radar to find out whom they are. It
establishes firstly how unconventional these two new surgeons are and secondly
how the military would view this as being very different from army procedures.
The overlapping sound allows for the telling of two stories simultaneously to
save time in exposing and setting up the characters.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The
inclusion of the song “Suicide is Painless” would be contrary to a lot of
people’s expectations for the beginning of the film. Already from the start we
know that it will be different because of the way it enforces the hopelessness
of the war. It is ironic that a song about suicide should begin for a film about
two surgeons since this would go against the doctor’s code of conduct. The
opening credits themselves help to bring the film into far more of an actuality
because of the juxtaposition of both elements to bring acceptability to all that
is happening. This song symbolizes both the process of war and the way in which
people are de-humanized to serve as canon fodder as well as to show the despair/sadness
which comes from living far from what our lives are about.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Through
the use of the public service announcement system is an interesting feature of
the film because the statements were recorded during the Korean war and added
into the film both to help us see what was happening outside the camp in the
rest of the world but also for the different daily routines of the camp. This
linking device from scene to scene was an accidental feature which helped carry
the story along was not thought of until the cutting room phase where it was
found that linking the various scenes would be to complicated without this
simple but effective device.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Character
development</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">The
characters within this film are an important of the film, without whom it may
flop. Trapper and Hawkeye are the two drafted surgeons who are in Korea against
their will and would rather go home than continue to serve in this useless war.
Hawkeye that is another key character helps move along the plot through leading
all the events, stealing the jeep as soon as the film begins and bringing it to
the MASH unit. The colonel is then another integral part of the film through his
unstereotypical method of running the camp where he drinks all the time without
being in control of the camp. With our regular army clowns whom are Major
Houlihan and Major Burns we are given a vision of what the military is supposed
to be where two people are striving to get what they believe is right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Major
Houlihan and religion dominate Major Burns. He is showing to us what a regular
army person is supposed to be through discipline and order. He is flawed though
through his religious belief in Christianity where the anti-Christian feeling is
shown through the aggravation which “Hawkeye” and “trapper” feels with
the religious chatter. Major Burns is himself going against his own teachers
through getting involved with Major Houlihan when he has a wife waiting for him
in America. All these elements come together fairly quickly within the film to
get him kicked out of the unit and sent to an asylum center.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Major
Houlihan is an interesting character because she has spent her life being in
different military bases and so is a regular army clown stuck in a nurse’s
uniform. She serves as an anti-hero because although she is a woman neither
Trapper nor Hawkeye want her. In a mess hall conversation between Nurse Houlihan
and Trapper she critics their antics and there is a very powerful moment where
we see that although Trapper is a womanizer he will not have Houlihan. The
effect this has on the audience is quite profound because of whom Trapper is.
Houlihan throughout the film is always trying to be far more important than she
is as shown through her union with Burns to write reports complaining about all
that is going on within the MASH unit. As her character develops she is broken
after the shower incident and becomes far more part of the background, as if a
loss of confidence was felt through the disrespect she has received.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">Genre theory</span></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">This
film may be located within Black comedy because of it’s comical portrayal of
draughted doctors whom go against the army and calls those such as “Hotlips”
regular army clowns going both against the government as well as the military
efforts in Vietnam and Korea. Within this film is the music at the beginning of
the film with words such as “Suicide is painless” showing what people
thought that fighting in war was about. The satire within the film can clearly
be seen through Major Burns whom is religious. Colonel Blake and other higher
figures are alcoholics and fairly relaxed.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">It
may fit into the war film genre because of it’s set being a mobile Army
surgical hospital but whereas in other films we see the point of view of the
soldiers in this film we are shown the view which the doctors would have had. In
so doing it went against the stereotypes of the Genre and brought a whole new
element towards war films. One of the strengths of this film is that it blends
the horrors of wars as shown through the graphic depiction of operations. These
operations at the time of the release of the film must have been truly horrific
for the audience whom although used to seeing the horror film genre had not yet
been shown what may happen to a person’s body when fighting against inhuman
weapons like grenades and more which may destroy life without effort.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The humor that is brought into this scene is very important for the film
not to get a different certification. The moment at which the surgeon asks for
his nose to be scratched suddenly relaxes the audience so that they do not see
it as being as bad as it would have been through withholding humor.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">A
key scene within this text is the depiction of the soldier’s whose dilemma
about having several future wives but not being able to get it up force him to
think about suicide and so through the pill scene we get both the theme of
suicide but within this the impression that going to war is also suicide. The
scene is one of the most powerful in the film because of the lighting, the
music, and the allusion to the last supper by Leonardo Da Vinci and more. It is
important because of the feeling of fighting a war, which is so remote from
America in terms of distance, the problems of relationships over such a long
distance and finally the importance of friends. Without the dark humor of the
scene someone would have given up life.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-indent:35.4pt"><span lang="EN-GB">Within
the film we find that genre theory is an important element to understand the
significance of MASH because knowing the context of the Genre as the genre will
affect who will see the movie. Through being a comedy people whom enjoy seeing
the lighter side of life will enjoy the film. At the same time through it’s
being a war film part of the audience who is so used to seeing glorious battles
on the screen will instead see the not so glorious side of the mobile army
surgical hospital and anti-war sentiment may thus be awoken or emphasized. With
knowledge of events such as the 1968 student riot which took place in Paris and
the analogue example of it through the doctor’s disregard for authority we are
encouraged to think differently and see independence from authority more
casually. The anti-war movements, which were taking place in America against the
Vietnam War, are both a reflection and a result of the film’s anti-authoritarian
sentiment. People whom no longer saw the point of fighting a war thousands of
miles away from home for certain ideologies saw MASH not as a film about Korea
but rather saw it as a film about Vietnam. Conclusively with the use of
over-lapping dialogue and more emphasizing the chaos of the scenes and the use
of unconventional angles allowed through changing technology the film becomes a
very powerful element of film making. Overall the feel and look of the film
allow it to stand out from films of that period because of it’s innovation.</span></p>
