 <h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="Fortifying_the_new_cities">Fortifying the new cities</a></h3>
    <p>The Roman army conquered the land and while they did that they built forts. The forts
    were normally wooden. They were spread around the frontier. They also had walls around the
    cities. The wall was built of stone and rocks. This made it very solid as it was made in a
    special way. The walls were made to be wide enough for soldiers to walk along them. They
    also opened the doors to the city. They had to pull the gates of the city up to let the
    people get in. The cities had different types of buildings in them. They put roads on top
    of it so that the vehicles from the troops can move more easily.</p>
    <h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><a NAME="Farming_the_land">Farming the land</a></h3>
    <p>The Romans conquered a lot of land and they had to get food to feed all the people in
    it so they had to find a way to feed everyone. Everyone was offered corn and if they
    didn't' t get it they got annoyed as it was considered a right. Caesar introduced the
    salary which was salt given to the people in order to thank them. The farmers were poor
    and lived in houses made of mud and straw or similar material. They also had some land to
    farm. They kept animals such as oxen or beef from which they got food and an income.
    Religion was an important part in the life of a farmer as he wanted a better life later.
    They sacrificed sheep and other animals and offered food to their gods. They looked upon
    the gods as those who were allowing them to make the crops grow.</p>
