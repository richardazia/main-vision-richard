<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>Wave Messaging</h2>        
      <p>Ever found yourself far from someone and wanted to send them a message 
        without using SMS on your mobile phone? Nokia have come up with the Nokia 
        3220. Twelve lights on the back of this phone blink at a rate so that 
        when you move the phone people the other side of the phone can see an 
        image appear in the air. This is done through tricking our eyes into seeing 
        an image through 12 flashing lights. 
      <p>This technology may be enjoyed mainly in concerts, night clubs and other 
        low light locations.
