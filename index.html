<h1>Richard's' Website</h1>
<h2>Blogging and Writing For the Web Since 1996</h2>
      <p>When I spend time online I often have
      difficulty finding a website which I find very interesting therefore I
      have decided to try to make a website which I would like to visit several
      times.</p>
      
            "My schooling not only failed to teach me what it professed
            to be teaching, but prevented me from being educated to an extent
            which infuriates me when I think of all I might have learned at home
            by myself."
            

            <cite>-- George Bernard Shaw</cite>

      This part of my page was started in 1996 after having 
      traveled around, Palmiye in Turkey, Ardèche in France and Rome in 
      Italy. I spent many hours working away. The result was a web site, 
      which I invite you to see.</p>
