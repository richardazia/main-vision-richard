<p>Part of the Enjoyment of having a website is seeing how many people are coming 
  to visit the site each month and observe the progression.I have done one or 
  two pieces of work analysing the website dynamics over a period of months. One 
  of the things that struck me most is the sine wave that is formed representing 
  the earth's rotation over the period of a day. Peaks can be spotted at certain 
  times of the year, when students have the most assignments on the Romans.</p>
<p>It is curious to note that other time Julius Caesar, Slavery and Latin are 
  the terms which appear to be searched for most. Whether this is because people 
  think of these two terms before researching the Romans or not is unsure. What 
  is sure is that this website is popular with a variety of website types linking 
  to it. </p>
<p>Within the last month there have been around nine hundred visitors a day and 
  overall over a quarter of a million visitors from more than a hundred countries. 
</p>
<p>The purpose and content of the website is changing and it will be interesting 
  to see how the search terms evolve from the Romans towards other subjects. </p>
