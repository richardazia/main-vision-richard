<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
<h2>Rumantsch On The Web</h2>
        <p>Switzerland is among those countries with several national 
          languages of which Italian, French and German are the best known. This 
          splits the country into language groups with less interaction between 
          various languages. There is another language which is heard of much 
          less and that is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rumantsch">Rumantch</a>. 
          It is a language spoken by only around 100,000 people of which 40,000 
          have it as a mother tongue. It is rare to find someone who can talk 
          Rumantsch but something interesting is available. </p>
        <p><a href="http://www.rtr.ch">www.rtr.ch</a> is the website 
          of the local radio and television for Rumantsch speaking people. It 
          is a window for the rest of the world to see what this regional dialect 
          sounds like. As the web makes narrow casting more interesting so broadband 
          allows for narrow casting to reach a wider audience. If you live in 
          Switzerland without access to the web then the only time you would have 
          had access to Rumantch programming is by waiting till SF1 stops broadcasting. 
          Now anyone can access this channel at anytime providing more exposure 
          to the language. </p>
        <p>I am sure that with time we will find that more and more 
          enthusiasts will take the world wide web and use it as a tool to learn 
          new languages, do language studies and more.As some people complain 
          about globalisation so the opposite is really happened, especially with 
          broadband web access and digital broadcasting. The audience for the 
          European Broadcasting union is 650 million viewers in Europe. The audience 
          on the web is theoretically the world if we forget about the digital 
          divide between technological countries and non technological countries.
