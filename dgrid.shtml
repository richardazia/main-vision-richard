<h1>Surfing the World Wide Waves (WWW)</h1>
        <h2>The Eurodatagrid project</h2>
        <p>The Euro datagrid project is an idea being developed at the CERN (European 
          Centre for Nuclear Research) to find a method of sharing computer power. 
          Within an air conditioned room at the CERN in Geneva you will find a 
          room full of computers on shelves with several machines but shelf with 
          around 1000 individual machines. The idea behind the datagrid project 
          is shared computer power across a multitude of machines. In other words 
          if you are working on some modelling, for example to see what the weather 
          will by like in StMoritz over the next few days. You make a request 
          over the Internet for a certain amount of computer power and send the 
          data along fibre optic links towards the CERN where an allocated number 
          of machines will help crunch the numbers to give you results about possible 
          weather patterns. </p>
        The idea is particularly interesting because in sharing the task among 
        many computers a cheap super computer is working but rather than having 
        a single machine which costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to rent 
        per day you have many more affordable part time machines doing the work.
