      <h2>Spam: advertising without polluting</h2>
      <p>How often do you receive unsolicited mail from different companies around 
        the world advertising products and telling you about making money? If 
        you're like me you receive quite a few of them a week and you get used 
        to receiving them and deleting them.</p>
      <p>This is where we get to the part of no pollution, conventional advertising 
        in magazines and in letters (snail mail) take up paper which you will 
        throw away anyway. Advertising electronically only takes a little disk 
        space and it can be deleted immediately therefore preventing waste.</p>
