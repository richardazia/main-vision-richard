<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves, a weekly article</h1>
        <h2><a href="http://www.nainwak.com">Nainwak</a></h2>
        <h3>Pretending to be garden gnomes.</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.nainwak.com">Nainwak</a>, 
          a game designed by University students is based around Garden Gnomes. 
          They are divided into three camps, brave gnomes who are the goodies, 
          rempant (rampant) which are the undecided and Sadiks. Every one has 
          his own gnome and the aim of the game is to kill all the gnomes on the 
          other side. Each time you kill a garden gnome you gain experience points 
          (xp). As time continues you will rise to higher and higher levels and 
          as this happens you will be able to improve four qualities, your life, 
          strength, precision and intelligence.</p>
        <p>What makes this game interesting 
          is the humour of the names and the weapons. At <a href="http://www.biblionainwak.com">biblionainwak</a> 
          you may see how many different versions of weapons and objects in general 
          there are. </p>
        <p>Another interesting feature of this game is the <a href="http://www.devastatus.net/nainwakmeteo/">Météonainwak</a> 
          which gives a map of each world and shows where the most brave, sadik 
          and Rampant gnomes there are. At the moment for example there are two 
          wars being thought, one at Puit sans Squat and Arena where I can be 
          found. Another interesting link is <a href="http://spyclub.levillage.org/">Spy 
          Club, le village </a> where by copying and pasting the code which appears at the top of your window in nainwak you are able to view the location of all the other players in the game.</p>
<p>Hope to add more with time, if you'd like to share your 
          own misfortunes then don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:richard@main-vision.com?subject=%22contribute%20to%20surfing%20pages%22">contact
