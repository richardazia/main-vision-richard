<h1>Surfing The World Wide Waves, a weekly article</h1>
<h2>The flipside</a></h2>
<h3>The Mind is a terrible thing to waste</h3>
<p>The Flipside is a british site with an international 
            group of people discussing many different topics. Amongst it's features 
            there is the sharing of images, debates about various topics from 
            everyday chat to science and technology, religion and philosophy, 
            current affairs and more. The group is quite strong and the speed 
            at which conversations take place is fast compared to some other forums.</p>
