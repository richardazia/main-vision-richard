<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This year marked the thirtieth Edition
of the Paleo festival de Nyon. It's a music festival that began by
the Nyon swimming pool and as it grew in importance migrated into the
countryside close to where I live. For a few years it has now been
taking place in Asse and many well known artists have come. This year
for example Calogero, Rammstein, Jamiroquai, Kyo, Mickey3d and other
artists decided to participate.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">I have only been to the festival twice
but rather than pay for the right to be there I took the option of
working as a collaborateur. The collaborateur work for free, payed in
drink, food, free stuff and free entrances to the festival. Two years
ago I was working inside the camping as part of the trotteur but this
year I was working at the acc&eacute;s. You see a huge amount of
people entering and leaving the site and some of these people are
friendly whilst others aren't. The people you work with are also
nice, making those five hour shifts fly by. 
</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Next year I hope to participate again
but in the meantime I'll leave you with some pictures from this
flickr group.</P>
