<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with all decisions concerning people and their possesions as
well as there way of life people are forced with the prospect of moving to somewhere safer
or in other cases for economic reasons</big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With examples to actual reasons of international migration I
will explain why those factors mentioned in A, B and C are encouraging people to move.
These factors which influence people with the desire to move could be those such as in
California where Mexicans move in the hope to get a better salary. They then go back to
Mexico where they have enough to live on for a while. Meanwhile in such places as the
Kosovo where there are whole towns who decide to move it is due to a fraction such as the
Serbs which are aggresive towards the local population therefore encouraging them to move
to another more welcoming place or simply up into the mountains where the rebel forces
won't come to attack. </big>(read NEWSWEEK to find out more) </p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People such as Indians used to migrate and some still do from
India to countries such as England where they hope to get a better education, therefore
getting a better chance at having a western life style and have ammased enough wealth to
start a company. However as in the case of Algerians and some other nationalities coming
to France they are blocked outside of that country because it(France) doesn't want its own
population diluted by an incessant influx of immigrants. This is when the barriers
mentioned in B come in. As people find out to their own disaray they sometimes leave their
country in the hope for a better life and once they have managed to they can't move back
to their country of origin due to such things as famine, civil war and many other factors
affecting people's lifes. One area though where people have gained more mobility is from
the West to the East and vise versa with the fall of communism and the fall of the Berlin
wall in 1989. </big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In countries such as France but also such as in Sri Lanka
between the Tamil and the Sinhalese there are frictions between the ethnic minorities as
well as the locals because they want to split the island so that the minority are in
possesion. </big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another more famous example of this is the situation which
arose between Israel and Palestine after World War II because the Palestinians were
exhiled from their own country which is modern day Israel so that they are living in no
man's land where the soil is so poor as to not be sufficient to support the population,
therefore this is a barrier created because one country and it's people have invaded
another and ejected them from it. </big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a country such as Switzerland if people want to work here
there is a barrier which prevents people from staying for long periods of time such as the
work permit whcih is only valid a certain amount of time and then the people have to move
back to their country of origin before being fined for staying illegaly in a country. </big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an event such as Chernobyl the factor affecting whether
people stay in the area or not is the danger of being irradiated by the nuclear waste
floating around for thousands of years. People therefore stay away from there not being
able to come back since the radioactivity is within the plants and all around the place
therefore it is too dangerous to human life.</big></p>

<p><big>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In conclusion there are many factors affecting whehter or not
people stay within an area but also many factors which help decide whether or not people
can stay, for how long and the causes for this decision to move. Some have been voluntary
while others have not therefore it is hard to generalise on one particular point. </big></p>
